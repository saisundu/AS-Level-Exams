## Section A: Short Answer Questions

### Q1 (a) Define the term ‘job description’. [2]  
A job description is a written statement outlining the key duties, responsibilities, and tasks associated with a particular role. It sets out what the employee is expected to do if appointed, and provides clarity to both employer and applicant.  
➡️ *AO1.*

### Q1 (b) Explain two advantages to an employer of using a person specification. [3]  
One advantage is that it clearly identifies the skills and qualities required, which helps to attract suitable candidates. This reduces wasted time reviewing unsuitable applications.  
A second advantage is that it deters unqualified applicants from applying, saving the employer recruitment costs and allowing the process to be completed more efficiently.  
➡️ *AO2 + AO3.*

### Q2 (a) Define the term ‘private sector’. [2]  
The private sector consists of businesses owned and controlled by individuals or groups of individuals rather than the government. These firms operate to earn profits and are accountable to their owners or shareholders.  
➡️ *AO1.*

### Q2 (b) Explain two advantages that a business in the public sector may have over a business in the private sector. [3]  
First, public sector businesses may have **easier access to finance** since they are often supported or funded by the government.  
Second, they are not under the same pressure to make a profit. This means they can focus on providing essential goods and services without worrying about shareholder dividends.  
➡️ *AO2 + AO3.*

### Q3 Explain the difficulties that a small business start-up might have when trying to obtain finance from an external source. [5]  
Small start-ups usually lack a financial history, making lenders reluctant to provide loans. They also have limited collateral to offer as security, which increases the lender’s risk. Inexperienced owners may fail to convince investors of viability, especially if the product is new or untested. As a result, external finance can be hard to secure, slowing growth and increasing the chance of failure.  
➡️ *AO2 + AO3 + AO4.*

### Q4 (a) Define the term ‘national market’. [2]  
A national market refers to the trade of goods and services within one country’s borders. It excludes international operations and focuses on domestic consumers and businesses.  
➡️ *AO1.*

### Q4 (b) Explain two advantages to a business of selling in international markets. [3]  
The first advantage is **access to a larger customer base**, which increases sales potential beyond the limitations of the national market.  
The second is the ability to achieve **economies of scale**, since producing for larger markets reduces average costs and improves competitiveness.  
➡️ *AO2 + AO3.*

## Section B: Essay Questions

### Q5 (a) Analyse the disadvantages to a business of using debt factoring to improve its cash flow. [8]

**Introduction**  
Debt factoring is when a business sells its accounts receivable to a third party at a discount to receive immediate cash. While it improves liquidity, there are disadvantages.  

**Body**  
One disadvantage is that the business does not receive the full value of its debts; typically, only around 80% is paid, which reduces potential income. Another issue is that debt factors usually reject long-term bad debts, so the business may still face uncollectable accounts. Customers may also dislike dealing with a third party, harming trust and loyalty. Additionally, reliance on debt factoring can signal financial weakness to investors and stakeholders, possibly damaging reputation.  

**Conclusion**  
Although debt factoring can solve short-term cash flow issues, it reduces profitability and risks harming customer relationships. It should therefore be used cautiously.

### Q5 (b) Discuss the limitations of using accounting ratios to compare the performance of different businesses. [12]

**Introduction**  
Accounting ratios are tools to compare profitability, liquidity, and efficiency. They can show trends and allow comparisons, but there are clear limitations.  

**Body**  
Firstly, businesses may use different accounting methods, such as depreciation policies, making ratios difficult to compare directly. Secondly, ratios are based on historical data and may not reflect current or future conditions, particularly if one firm is about to launch a new product. Ratios also lack qualitative insights, such as employee morale or brand strength, which can significantly affect performance. Comparisons are only meaningful between similar businesses in the same industry; otherwise, size and structure differences distort results. Furthermore, ratios are snapshots based on a specific date, which might not represent seasonal fluctuations.  

**Conclusion**  
Ratios provide useful guidance but cannot be the sole basis for comparison. They should be supported with qualitative information and industry-specific context for reliable analysis.

### Q6 ‘Good leaders are more important for business success than good managers.’ Discuss the extent to which you agree. [20]

**Introduction**  
Leaders inspire and set vision, while managers plan, organise, and control resources. Both roles are crucial to business success, but their relative importance is debated.  

**Body**  
Leaders bring creativity, charisma, and confidence, motivating employees to strive for ambitious goals. They can inspire innovation and differentiate a business from competitors. However, without effective managers, even the best vision may fail. Managers ensure resources are used efficiently, deadlines are met, and operations run smoothly. In reality, the two roles are interdependent: leaders drive direction, while managers implement ideas.  
Evaluation can also highlight that in some contexts one role may dominate. For example, in dynamic industries requiring vision, leadership may be more critical, while in stable, process-driven firms, management efficiency is key.  

**Conclusion**  
Both leaders and managers are essential. Success depends on balance and cooperation between the two. Claiming one is “more important” oversimplifies; each has a critical role at different stages of business growth.

### Q7 (a) Analyse the possible disadvantages of Computer Aided Manufacture (CAM) for a small manufacturing business. [8]

**Introduction**  
Computer Aided Manufacture (CAM) uses computer-controlled systems in production. While often efficient, it has disadvantages for small firms.  

**Body**  
The main drawback is the **high initial cost** of purchasing and installing CAM systems, which may strain limited budgets. Small businesses may also lack the skilled workers needed to operate advanced systems, forcing redundancies or expensive new hires. CAM may undermine businesses built on hand-crafted uniqueness, such as furniture makers, potentially eroding their unique selling proposition (USP).  

**Conclusion**  
For small businesses, CAM can create financial and operational challenges that may outweigh benefits. It should be adopted only if clear efficiency gains are achievable.

### Q7 (b) Discuss the importance of process innovation for a manufacturer of car components in a competitive market. [12]

**Introduction**  
Process innovation involves implementing new or significantly improved production or delivery methods. In competitive markets, efficiency and quality are vital.  

**Body**  
Process innovation can reduce costs through automation or new methods, increasing competitiveness. It can also improve quality, which is essential for car manufacturers relying on reliable components. Faster processes shorten delivery times, supporting just-in-time (JIT) systems and strengthening supplier relationships. However, innovation can be costly and may not always succeed. Smaller firms may struggle to afford it, and benefits depend on scale and market conditions.  

**Conclusion**  
Process innovation is important in competitive markets because it enhances efficiency, quality, and customer satisfaction. However, its significance depends on a firm’s resources and competitive position. For dominant players, it is essential; for smaller firms, the costs must be weighed carefully.
