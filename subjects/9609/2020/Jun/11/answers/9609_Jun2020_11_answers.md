### Q2 (a) Define the term ‘opportunity cost’. [2]

➡️ *AO1.*

### Q2 (b) Explain two reasons why many new businesses fail in their first year. [3]  
One reason is **lack of finance**. A start-up may need months before sales cover costs, and without sufficient capital it can quickly run out of cash.

### Q3 Explain why it is important for a manufacturing business to manage its inventory effectively. [5]  
Managing inventory ensures that there are enough raw materials to keep production running smoothly. If inventory is too low, production may stop, wasting labour and machinery time, and disappointing customers with delays. On the other hand, holding too much inventory increases costs through storage, insurance, and the risk of obsolescence. Effective management balances these risks, ensuring consistent production while minimising costs.  
➡️ *AO1, AO2, AO3, AO4.*

➡️ *AO1.*

### Q4 (b) Explain two disadvantages to a business of using price discrimination. [3]  
One disadvantage is the risk of **customer dissatisfaction** if buyers discover they are paying more than others, potentially damaging reputation.  
Another disadvantage is **administrative complexity**, since managing different prices across markets requires careful systems and may increase costs.  
➡️ *AO2 + AO3.*

## Section B: Essay Questions

### Q5 (a) Analyse the possible benefits to a business of increasing its market share. [8]

**Introduction**  
Market share is the percentage of total industry sales a business holds. Increasing it can bring strategic and financial benefits.  

**Body**  
A larger market share usually leads to **greater sales and revenue**, strengthening financial performance. It also improves **brand recognition**, making the business more attractive to new customers. With greater scale, the business can achieve **economies of scale**, lowering unit costs and allowing either higher profit margins or more competitive pricing. Moreover, firms with significant market share gain **market power**, sometimes enabling them to influence prices and secure favourable deals with suppliers and distributors.  

**Conclusion**  
Increasing market share boosts both competitiveness and profitability, making it a key objective for many firms. However, the benefits depend on sustaining customer satisfaction and efficient operations.

### Q5 (b) Discuss whether a change in consumer income is the most important factor influencing the demand for restaurant meals. [12]

**Introduction**  
Consumer income influences how much people are willing to spend on eating out. Restaurant meals are often discretionary purchases, so income changes can affect demand strongly.  

**Body**  
When incomes fall, many households cut back on dining at restaurants, especially expensive ones. Conversely, rising incomes increase demand for eating out, particularly at mid- to high-end venues. However, the impact varies by type of restaurant: budget restaurants may see increased demand during downturns as people “trade down” from luxury options.  
Other factors also affect demand. **Tastes and preferences** can shift due to health concerns or new food trends. **Competition** from rivals or fast-food chains can reduce demand at some restaurants regardless of income. **External factors** such as housing costs or broader economic changes may limit disposable income even when earnings rise.  

**Conclusion**  
Changes in consumer income are highly important, but they are not the only determinant. Restaurant demand also depends on consumer preferences, competition, and broader economic conditions. Income is a key factor, but not always the most important.

### Q6 ‘In a large computer manufacturing business, the operations department is more important for achieving success than the marketing department.’ Discuss the extent to which you agree. [20]

**Introduction**  
Operations ensures products are produced efficiently and to quality standards, while marketing identifies customer needs and promotes the products. Both functions are vital, especially in competitive industries such as computer manufacturing.  

**Body**  
Operations is critical in producing high-quality computers at scale. Choosing the right production methods, maintaining quality control, and securing reliable suppliers are essential to customer satisfaction. Without strong operations, marketing promises cannot be delivered.  
Marketing, however, ensures that the business understands customer needs, such as demand for faster processors or new features. It also communicates the brand to consumers, creating demand. If marketing is weak, even the best computers may fail to sell.  
The departments are interdependent. Marketing research guides what operations should produce, while operations determines whether marketing’s promises can be met. In a fast-changing tech industry, R&D may also be considered equally important.  

**Conclusion**  
It is not accurate to say operations is more important than marketing. Success in large-scale computer manufacturing depends on close coordination between both. Each supports the other, and neglecting one would undermine overall success.

### Q7 (a) Analyse the benefits to a new business of using break-even analysis. [8]

**Introduction**  
Break-even analysis shows the output level where total revenue equals total cost. It is a useful planning tool for new businesses.  

**Body**  
It helps entrepreneurs estimate how much they need to sell to avoid losses. By testing different prices or cost structures, it provides guidance on whether the business idea is viable. It highlights whether fixed costs are too high and whether cheaper alternatives should be considered. For inexperienced o
