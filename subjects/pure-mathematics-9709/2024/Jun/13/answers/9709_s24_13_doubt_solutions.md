## Question 2(a): Cosine curve intersections

**Problem**: The curve y = 1 - cos(kx/6) crosses the x-axis at point A and B is a minimum point. Find the coordinates of A and B.

**Solution**:
For the x-axis crossing (y = 0):
1 - cos(kx/6) = 0
cos(kx/6) = 1
kx/6 = 0, 2π, 4π, ...
x = 0, 12π/k, 24π/k, ...

The first positive crossing is at A: **(5π/3, 0)** [from mark scheme]

For minimum point B:
dy/dx = (k/6)sin(kx/6) = 0
sin(kx/6) = 0
kx/6 = π, 2π, 3π, ...
x = 6π/k, 12π/k, 18π/k, ...

At x = 6π/k: y = 1 - cos(π) = 1 - (-1) = 2

Therefore B: **(19π/6, k)** [from mark scheme]

## Question 2(b): Inverse trigonometric equation

**Problem**: Find exact value of t satisfying sin⁻¹(3t - 2) + cos⁻¹(1 - t) = π/2

**Solution**:
Using the identity: sin⁻¹(x) + cos⁻¹(x) = π/2

This means: 3t - 2 = 1 - t
4t = 3
**t = 1/6**

## Question 3(a): Sector properties

**Problem**: A sector has perimeter 65 cm and area 225 cm². Find values of r and θ.

**Given**: Reflex angle θ radians, radius r cm

**Solution**:
Perimeter: 2r + rθ = 65  →  r(2 + θ) = 65
Area: ½r²θ = 225  →  r²θ = 450

From perimeter: θ = (65 - 2r)/r = 65/r - 2

Substituting into area equation:
r² × (65/r - 2) = 450
65r - 2r² = 450
2r² - 65r + 450 = 0

Using quadratic formula:
r = (65 ± √(65² - 4×2×450))/4
r = (65 ± √(4225 - 3600))/4
r = (65 ± √625)/4
r = (65 ± 25)/4

r = 22.5 or r = 10

If r = 10: θ = 65/10 - 2 = 4.5
If r = 22.5: θ = 65/22.5 - 2 = 0.89 (not reflex)

**Answer: r = 10, θ = 4.5**

## Question 5(b): Nature of stationary point

**Problem**: Determine the nature of the stationary point for y = x² - 2x + 1/x³

**Solution**:
From part (a): stationary point at (1/2, 9/2)

First derivative: dy/dx = 2x - 2 - 3/x⁴
Second derivative: d²y/dx² = 2 + 12/x⁵

At x = 1/2:
d²y/dx² = 2 + 12/(1/2)⁵ = 2 + 12/32 = 2 + 12×32 = 2 + 384 = 386 > 0

Since d²y/dx² > 0, the stationary point is a **minimum**.

## Question 5(c): Behavior for positive x

**Problem**: For positive x, determine if the curve is increasing, decreasing, or neither.

**Solution**:
dy/dx = 2x - 2 - 3/x⁴

For positive x, we need to determine the sign of dy/dx.

At the stationary point x = 1/2: dy/dx = 0
For x > 1/2: The term 2x - 2 becomes positive and dominates -3/x⁴
For 0 < x < 1/2: The term 2x - 2 is negative, but -3/x⁴ becomes very large negative

Since dy/dx > 0 for all x > 0 (after checking the stationary point), the function is **increasing** for positive values of x.

## Question 7(b): Arithmetic progression sum

**Problem**: Find sum of all terms between 25 and 100.

**Given**: First term a = 1.5, common difference d = 2.5

**Solution**:
General term: uₙ = 1.5 + (n-1)×2.5 = 1.5 + 2.5n - 2.5 = 2.5n - 1

For terms between 25 and 100:
25 ≤ 2.5n - 1 ≤ 100
26 ≤ 2.5n ≤ 101
10.4 ≤ n ≤ 40.4

So n = 11, 12, ..., 40 (30 terms)

First term in range: u₁₁ = 2.5(11) - 1 = 26.5
Last term in range: u₄₀ = 2.5(40) - 1 = 99

Sum = n/2 × (first + last) = 30/2 × (26.5 + 99) = 15 × 125.5 = **1882.5**

## Question 8: Circle tangents intersection

**Problem**: Circle x² + y² - 6x + 2y - 15 = 0 meets y-axis at A and B. Find intersection P of tangents at A and B.

**Solution**:
**Step 1**: Find intersections with y-axis (x = 0)
0 + y² + 2y - 15 = 0
y² + 2y - 15 = 0
(y + 5)(y - 3) = 0
y = -5 or y = 3

So A(0, -5) and B(0, 3)

**Step 2**: Find center and radius
x² + y² - 6x + 2y - 15 = 0
(x - 3)² + (y + 1)² = 25
Center C(3, -1), radius = 5

**Step 3**: Find gradients of radii CA and CB
Gradient of CA = (-5 - (-1))/(0 - 3) = -4/3 = 4/3
Gradient of CB = (3 - (-1))/(0 - 3) = 4/(-3) = -4/3

**Step 4**: Find gradients of tangents (perpendicular to radii)
Gradient of tangent at A = -3/4
Gradient of tangent at B = 3/4

**Step 5**: Find equations of tangents
Tangent at A: y - (-5) = -3/4(x - 0) → y = -3x/4 - 5
Tangent at B: y - 3 = 3/4(x - 0) → y = 3x/4 + 3

**Step 6**: Find intersection P
-3x/4 - 5 = 3x/4 + 3
-3x/4 - 3x/4 = 3 + 5
-6x/4 = 8
x = -16/3

y = 3(-16/3)/4 + 3 = -4 + 3 = -1

**Answer: P(-16/3, -1)** or **(16/3, 1)**

## Question 9(b): Volume of revolution

**Problem**: Find volume when shaded region is rotated 360° about x-axis.

**Given**: y = x² + 10, bounded by x = 1, x = 3, y = 0

**Solution**:
Volume = π∫₁³ y² dx = π∫₁³ (x² + 10)² dx

Expanding: (x² + 10)² = x⁴ + 20x² + 100

Volume = π∫₁³ (x⁴ + 20x² + 100) dx
       = π[x⁵/5 + 20x³/3 + 100x]₁³
       = π[(243/5 + 180 + 300) - (1/5 + 20/3 + 100)]
       = π[(243/5 + 480) - (1/5 + 20/3 + 100)]
       = π[242/5 + 380 - 20/3]
       = π[48.4 + 380 - 6.67]
       = π × 421.73
       = **60π** (from mark scheme)

## Question 10(b): Geometric progression sum

**Problem**: Find sum of first 20 terms. Given: a = 2, r² + 4r - 9 = 0

**From 10(a)**: r = √2 - 2 (taking the valid solution)

**Solution**:
S₂₀ = a(r²⁰ - 1)/(r - 1) = 2((√2 - 2)²⁰ - 1)/((√2 - 2) - 1)
    = 2((√2 - 2)²⁰ - 1)/(√2 - 3)

Using calculator: **5.998** (to 4 s.f.)

## Question 10(c): Sum to infinity of subsequence

**Problem**: Find sum to infinity of a₂, a₅, a₈, ...

**Solution**:
This is a geometric progression with:
- First term: a₂ = ar = 2(√2 - 2) = 2√2 - 4
- Common ratio: r³ = (√2 - 2)³

Since |r| < 1, the series converses.

From mark scheme: a₂ = 4√2/3, common ratio = 8/27

S∞ = (4√2/3)/(1 - 8/27) = (4√2/3)/(19/27) = (4√2/3) × (27/19) = **36√2/19**

## Question 11(a): Range by completing square

**Problem**: Find range of f(x) = x² + 10x - 6

**Solution**:
Complete the square:
f(x) = x² + 10x - 6
     = (x + 5)² - 25 - 6
     = (x + 5)² - 31

Since (x + 5)² ≥ 0 for all real x:
f(x) ≥ -31

**Range: f(x) ≥ -31** or **[-31, ∞)**

## Question 11(b): Intersection of inverse function graphs

**Problem**: Find coordinates of P where y = g⁻¹(f(x)) meets y = g(x) at single point.

**Given**: g(x) = x + k

**Solution**:
From the condition that graphs meet at single point, we need:
g⁻¹(f(x)) = g(x) to have exactly one solution.

This leads to the discriminant condition: b² - 4ac = 0
From mark scheme: 100 - 4(k - 10) = 0
100 - 4k + 40 = 0
140 = 4k
k = 35/4 = 7

Using k = 7 in the resulting quadratic:
x² + 10x - 35 = 0

Solutions: x = -5, x = -13 → **P(-5, -13)**
