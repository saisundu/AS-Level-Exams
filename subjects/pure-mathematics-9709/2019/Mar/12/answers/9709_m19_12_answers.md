## Question 1 (3 marks) - Binomial Expansion
**The coefficient of x³ in the expansion of (1 - px)⁵ is -2160. Find the value of the constant p.**

### Solution:
Using the binomial theorem: (1 - px)⁵ = Σ ⁵Cᵣ (1)⁵⁻ʳ (-px)ʳ

General term: ⁵Cᵣ (-px)ʳ = ⁵Cᵣ (-1)ʳ pʳ xʳ

For the coefficient of x³, we need r = 3:
Coefficient of x³ = ⁵C₃ (-1)³ p³ = 10 × (-1) × p³ = -10p³

Given that this coefficient equals -2160:
-10p³ = -2160
10p³ = 2160
p³ = 216
p = ∛216 = **6**

## Question 2 (5 marks) - Integration & Curve Fitting
**A curve y = f(x) passes through points (0, 2) and (3, -1). Given f'(x) = kx² - 2x, find k.**

### Solution:
Since f'(x) = kx² - 2x, we integrate to find f(x):
f(x) = ∫(kx² - 2x)dx = (k/3)x³ - x² + c

Using the point (0, 2):
f(0) = 2
(k/3)(0)³ - (0)² + c = 2
c = 2

So: f(x) = (k/3)x³ - x² + 2

Using the point (3, -1):
f(3) = -1
(k/3)(3)³ - (3)² + 2 = -1
(k/3)(27) - 9 + 2 = -1
9k - 7 = -1
9k = 6
**k = 2/3**

## Question 3 (6 marks) - Circle Geometry & Areas
**CXD is a semicircle of radius 7 cm with centre A and diameter CD. Line YABX is perpendicular to CD, and arc CYD is part of a circle with centre B and radius 8 cm. Find the total area enclosed by the two arcs.**

### Solution:
**Step 1:** Set up coordinate system
Let A be at origin, CD horizontal with C at (-7, 0) and D at (7, 0)
Since YABX ⊥ CD, B is at (0, h) for some height h

**Step 2:** Find position of B
Since arc CYD has centre B and radius 8:
|BC| = 8
√((-7-0)² + (0-h)²) = 8
√(49 + h²) = 8
49 + h² = 64
h² = 15
h = √15 (taking positive value)

So B is at (0, √15)

**Step 3:** Find angles
For semicircle CXD: angle subtended = π radians
For arc CYD with centre B:
cos(∠CBD/2) = |BD|/(2×8) where |BD| = 8
Since triangle BCD is isosceles with BC = BD = 8 and CD = 14:
Using cosine rule: CD² = BC² + BD² - 2(BC)(BD)cos(∠CBD)
196 = 64 + 64 - 128cos(∠CBD)
cos(∠CBD) = (128-196)/128 = -68/128 = -17/32
∠CBD = arccos(-17/32) ≈ 2.13 radians

**Step 4:** Calculate areas
Area of semicircle CXD = (1/2)π(7)² = 49π/2

Area of sector CYD = (1/2)(8)²(∠CBD) = 32 × arccos(-17/32)

**Step 5:** Find enclosed area
The region is bounded by both arcs. Using geometric analysis:
Total area = Area of sector CYD - Area of triangle BCD + Area of semicircle CXD - Area of triangle ACD

After calculation: **Total area = 49π/2 + 32arccos(-17/32) - 49√15/2**

Numerically: **≈ 77.0 + 68.2 - 94.8 ≈ 50.4 cm²**

## Question 4 (7 marks) - Calculus & Stationary Points
**Curve y = (2x - 1)^(-1) + 2x**

### Part (i) (3 marks)
**Find dy/dx and d²y/dx²**

### Solution:
y = (2x - 1)⁻¹ + 2x

dy/dx = -1(2x - 1)⁻² × 2 + 2 = -2(2x - 1)⁻² + 2 = **-2/(2x - 1)² + 2**

d²y/dx² = -2 × (-2)(2x - 1)⁻³ × 2 = **8/(2x - 1)³**

### Part (ii) (4 marks)
**Find x-coordinates of stationary points and determine their nature**

### Solution:
At stationary points: dy/dx = 0
-2/(2x - 1)² + 2 = 0
2 = 2/(2x - 1)²
(2x - 1)² = 1
2x - 1 = ±1

Case 1: 2x - 1 = 1 → x = 1
Case 2: 2x - 1 = -1 → x = 0

**Testing nature using second derivative:**
d²y/dx² = 8/(2x - 1)³

At x = 1: d²y/dx² = 8/(2(1) - 1)³ = 8/1³ = 8 > 0 → **Minimum**
At x = 0: d²y/dx² = 8/(2(0) - 1)³ = 8/(-1)³ = -8 < 0 → **Maximum**

**Stationary points: x = 0 (maximum), x = 1 (minimum)**

## Question 5 (7 marks) - 3D Vectors
**u = (q, 2, 6) and v = (8, q-1, q²-7), where q is a constant**

### Part (i) (3 marks)
**Find values of q for which u is perpendicular to v**

### Solution:
For perpendicular vectors: u · v = 0
u · v = q(8) + 2(q-1) + 6(q²-7)
= 8q + 2q - 2 + 6q² - 42
= 6q² + 10q - 44

Setting equal to 0:
6q² + 10q - 44 = 0
3q² + 5q - 22 = 0

Using quadratic formula:
q = (-5 ± √(25 + 264))/6 = (-5 ± √289)/6 = (-5 ± 17)/6

**q = 2 or q = -11/3**

### Part (ii) (4 marks)
**Find angle between u and v when q = 0**

### Solution:
When q = 0:
u = (0, 2, 6)
v = (8, -1, -7)

u · v = 0(8) + 2(-1) + 6(-7) = 0 - 2 - 42 = -44

|u| = √(0² + 2² + 6²) = √(4 + 36) = √40 = 2√10
|v| = √(8² + (-1)² + (-7)²) = √(64 + 1 + 49) = √114

cos θ = (u · v)/(|u||v|) = -44/(2√10 × √114) = -44/(2√1140) = -22/√1140

θ = arccos(-22/√1140) = arccos(-22/√1140)

**θ ≈ 128.2°**

## Question 6 (7 marks) - Progressions
**First and second terms are p and 2p respectively**

### Part (i) (2 marks) - Geometric Progression
**Show that if sum of first n terms > 1000p, then 2ⁿ > 1001**

### Solution:
For GP with first term p and common ratio r = 2p/p = 2:
Sₙ = p(2ⁿ - 1)/(2 - 1) = p(2ⁿ - 1)

Given: Sₙ > 1000p
p(2ⁿ - 1) > 1000p
2ⁿ - 1 > 1000
**2ⁿ > 1001** ✓

### Part (ii) (5 marks) - Arithmetic Progression
**nth term is 336, sum of first n terms is 7224. Find n and p**

### Solution:
For AP with first term p and common difference d = 2p - p = p:
nth term: Tₙ = p + (n-1)p = np
Sum: Sₙ = (n/2)[2p + (n-1)p] = (n/2)[p(n+1)] = np(n+1)/2

Given equations:
np = 336 ... (1)
np(n+1)/2 = 7224 ... (2)

From (1): p = 336/n
Substituting into (2):
n(336/n)(n+1)/2 = 7224
336(n+1)/2 = 7224
168(n+1) = 7224
n+1 = 43
**n = 42**

From (1): p = 336/42 = **8**

## Question 7 (8 marks) - Trigonometry
### Part (a) (5 marks)
**Solve 3sin²θ + 8cos2θ = 0 for 0° ≤ θ ≤ 180°**

### Solution:
Using cos2θ = 1 - 2sin²θ:
3sin²θ + 8(1 - 2sin²θ) = 0
3sin²θ + 8 - 16sin²θ = 0
-13sin²θ + 8 = 0
sin²θ = 8/13
sin θ = ±√(8/13) = ±2√2/√13

Since 0° ≤ θ ≤ 180°, sin θ ≥ 0:
sin θ = 2√2/√13

θ = arcsin(2√2/√13) ≈ 51.3°
θ = 180° - 51.3° ≈ 128.7°

**θ = 51.3°, 128.7°**

### Part (b) (3 marks)
**Graph y = a + tan(bx) intersects x-axis at (-π/6, 0) and y-axis at (0, -√3). Find a and b**

### Solution:
At y-axis (x = 0): y = -√3
a + tan(b × 0) = -√3
a + tan(0) = -√3
a + 0 = -√3
**a = -√3**

At x-axis (x = -π/6): y = 0
-√3 + tan(b × (-π/6)) = 0
tan(-bπ/6) = √3
-bπ/6 = π/3 (since tan(π/3) = √3)
-b/6 = 1/3
**b = -2**

## Question 8 (10 marks) - Functions & Inverses
### Part (i) (2 marks)
**Express x² - 4x + 7 in the form (x + a)² + b**

### Solution:
x² - 4x + 7 = (x² - 4x + 4) + 7 - 4 = (x - 2)² + 3
**a = -2, b = 3**

### Part (ii) (1 mark)
**Largest value of k for which f is decreasing**

### Solution:
f(x) = x² - 4x + 7 = (x - 2)² + 3
f'(x) = 2x - 4 = 2(x - 2)

f is decreasing when f'(x) < 0, i.e., when x < 2
**k = 2**

### Part (iii) (3 marks)
**Find f⁻¹(x) when k = 1, and state domain**

### Solution:
For x < 1, f(x) = x² - 4x + 7
Let y = x² - 4x + 7
x² - 4x + (7 - y) = 0

Using quadratic formula:
x = (4 ± √(16 - 4(7 - y)))/2 = (4 ± √(4y - 12))/2 = 2 ± √(y - 3)

Since x < 1, we take the negative root:
x = 2 - √(y - 3)

Therefore: **f⁻¹(x) = 2 - √(x - 3)**

Domain: x - 3 ≥ 0, so **x ≥ 3**

### Part (iv) (4 marks)
**Find gf(x) where g(x) = 2/(x-1) for x > 1, and state range**

### Solution:
gf(x) = g(f(x)) = g(x² - 4x + 7) = 2/((x² - 4x + 7) - 1) = 2/(x² - 4x + 6)

For x < 1: x² - 4x + 6 = (x - 2)² + 2
Since x < 1, (x - 2)² > 1, so (x - 2)² + 2 > 3
Therefore x² - 4x + 6 > 3

**gf(x) = 2/(x² - 4x + 6)**

Range: Since x² - 4x + 6 > 3, we have 0 < 2/(x² - 4x + 6) < 2/3
**Range: (0, 2/3)**

## Question 9 (10 marks) - Volume of Revolution & Normal
**Curve y = √(x³ + x²)**

### Part (i) (4 marks)
**Find volume when shaded region is rotated about x-axis**

### Solution:
Volume = π∫₀³ y² dx = π∫₀³ (x³ + x²) dx

= π[x⁴/4 + x³/3]₀³
= π[(3⁴/4 + 3³/3) - (0)]
= π[81/4 + 27/3]
= π[81/4 + 36/4]
= π[117/4]

**Volume = 117π/4**

### Part (ii) (6 marks)
**Find y-coordinate where normal at P(3, y) crosses y-axis**

### Solution:
At x = 3: y = √(3³ + 3²) = √(27 + 9) = √36 = 6
So P = (3, 6)

dy/dx = d/dx[√(x³ + x²)] = (3x² + 2x)/(2√(x³ + x²))

At x = 3: dy/dx = (3(9) + 2(3))/(2√36) = (27 + 6)/(2 × 6) = 33/12 = 11/4

Gradient of normal = -1/(11/4) = -4/11

Equation of normal at P(3, 6):
y - 6 = (-4/11)(x - 3)
y = (-4/11)x + 12/11 + 6
y = (-4/11)x + 12/11 + 66/11
y = (-4/11)x + 78/11

At y-axis (x = 0): y = 78/11

**y-coordinate = 78/11**

## Question 10 (12 marks) - Curve Intersections & Tangents
**Curve y = 4x^(1/2)**

### Part (i) (6 marks)
**Line y = x + 3 intersects curve at A and B. Find length AB**

### Solution:
Intersection points: 4√x = x + 3
Let u = √x, so x = u² and u ≥ 0:
4u = u² + 3
u² - 4u + 3 = 0
(u - 1)(u - 3) = 0
u = 1 or u = 3

When u = 1: x = 1, y = 4
When u = 3: x = 9, y = 12

So A = (1, 4) and B = (9, 12)

Length AB = √[(9-1)² + (12-4)²] = √[64 + 64] = √128 = **8√2**

### Part (ii) (3 marks)
**Find coordinates of T where tangent is parallel to AB**

### Solution:
Gradient of AB = (12-4)/(9-1) = 8/8 = 1

dy/dx = d/dx[4x^(1/2)] = 4 × (1/2)x^(-1/2) = 2/√x

For parallel tangent: 2/√x = 1
√x = 2
x = 4

At x = 4: y = 4√4 = 8

**T = (4, 8)**

### Part (iii) (3 marks)
**Find intersection of normal at T with line AB**

### Solution:
Gradient of normal at T = -1/1 = -1

Equation of normal at T(4, 8):
y - 8 = -1(x - 4)
y = -x + 4 + 8
y = -x + 12

Intersection with line AB (y = x + 3):
-x + 12 = x + 3
2x = 9
x = 9/2

y = 9/2 + 3 = 15/2

**Intersection point = (9/2, 15/2)**
