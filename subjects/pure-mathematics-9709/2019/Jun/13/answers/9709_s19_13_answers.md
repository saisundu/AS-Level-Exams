## Question 1 (5 marks) - Quadratic Functions
**The function f is defined by f(x) = x² - 4x + 8 for x ∈ ℝ.**

### Part (i) (2 marks)
**Express x² - 4x + 8 in the form (x - a)² + b.**

### Solution:
Completing the square:
x² - 4x + 8 = (x² - 4x + 4) + 8 - 4 = (x - 2)² + 4

Therefore: **a = 2, b = 4**
**x² - 4x + 8 = (x - 2)² + 4**

### Part (ii) (3 marks)
**Hence find the set of values of x for which f(x) < 9, giving your answer in exact form.**

### Solution:
f(x) < 9
(x - 2)² + 4 < 9
(x - 2)² < 5
|x - 2| < √5
-√5 < x - 2 < √5
2 - √5 < x < 2 + √5

Therefore: **2 - √5 < x < 2 + √5**

## Question 2 (5 marks) - Binomial Expansion
**In the binomial expansion of (2x - 1/(2x))⁵, the first three terms are 32x⁵ - 40x³ + 20x.**

### Part (i) (3 marks)
**Find the remaining three terms of the expansion.**

### Solution:
Using the binomial theorem: (a + b)⁵ = Σ ⁵Cᵣ a⁵⁻ʳ bʳ

Here: a = 2x, b = -1/(2x)

General term: ⁵Cᵣ (2x)⁵⁻ʳ (-1/(2x))ʳ = ⁵Cᵣ (2)⁵⁻ʳ (-1)ʳ (2)⁻ʳ x⁵⁻²ʳ

Given first three terms (r = 0, 1, 2), we need r = 3, 4, 5:

**r = 3:** ⁵C₃ (2)² (-1)³ (2)⁻³ x⁻¹ = 10 × 4 × (-1) × (1/8) × (1/x) = **-5/x**

**r = 4:** ⁵C₄ (2)¹ (-1)⁴ (2)⁻⁴ x⁻³ = 5 × 2 × 1 × (1/16) × (1/x³) = **5/(8x³)**

**r = 5:** ⁵C₅ (2)⁰ (-1)⁵ (2)⁻⁵ x⁻⁵ = 1 × 1 × (-1) × (1/32) × (1/x⁵) = **-1/(32x⁵)**

**Remaining terms: -5/x + 5/(8x³) - 1/(32x⁵)**

### Part (ii) (2 marks)
**Hence find the coefficient of x in the expansion of (1 + 4x²)(2x - 1/(2x))⁵.**

### Solution:
(1 + 4x²)(32x⁵ - 40x³ + 20x - 5/x + 5/(8x³) - 1/(32x⁵))

For coefficient of x¹:
- From 1 × (20x): coefficient = 20
- From 4x² × (-5/x): coefficient = 4 × (-5) = -20

Total coefficient of x = 20 + (-20) = **0**

## Question 3 (6 marks) - Trigonometry & Circle Geometry
**Triangle ABC is right-angled at A. Angle ABC = π/5 radians and AC = 8 cm. Points D and E lie on BC and BA respectively. Sector ADE is part of a circle with centre A such that BDC is tangent to arc DE at D.**

### Part (i) (3 marks)
**Find the length of AD.**

### Solution:
In right triangle ABC:
- Angle ABC = π/5
- AC = 8 cm
- Angle BAC = π/2

Using trigonometry in triangle ABC:
tan(π/5) = AC/AB = 8/AB
AB = 8/tan(π/5)

Since BDC is tangent to the circle at D, angle ADB = π/2
In right triangle ABD:
cos(π/5) = AD/AB

From triangle ABC: AB = 8/tan(π/5) = 8 cot(π/5)
Therefore: AD = AB cos(π/5) = 8 cot(π/5) cos(π/5) = 8 cos(π/5)/sin(π/5) × cos(π/5)
AD = 8 cos²(π/5)/sin(π/5)

Using the identity: cos²(π/5) = (1 + cos(2π/5))/2
And sin(π/5) = sin(36°) ≈ 0.588

**AD = 8 cos²(π/5)/sin(π/5) ≈ 6.47 cm**

### Part (ii) (3 marks)
**Find the area of the shaded region.**

### Solution:
The shaded region = Area of triangle ABC - Area of sector ADE

Area of triangle ABC = (1/2) × AB × AC = (1/2) × 8 cot(π/5) × 8 = 32 cot(π/5)

For sector ADE:
- Radius = AD = 8 cos²(π/5)/sin(π/5)
- Angle DAE = π/2 (since angle BAC = π/2)

Area of sector ADE = (1/2) × (AD)² × (π/2) = (π/4) × (AD)²
= (π/4) × (8 cos²(π/5)/sin(π/5))²

**Shaded area = 32 cot(π/5) - (π/4) × 64 cos⁴(π/5)/sin²(π/5)**

## Question 4 (5 marks) - Functions & Composite Functions
**Function f: f(x) = 48/(x-1) for 3 ≤ x ≤ 7. Function g: g(x) = 2x - 4 for a ≤ x ≤ b.**

### Part (i) (2 marks)
**Find the greatest value of a and the least value of b which will permit the formation of gf.**

### Solution:
For gf to exist, the range of f must be contained in the domain of g.

Range of f when 3 ≤ x ≤ 7:
- At x = 3: f(3) = 48/(3-1) = 24
- At x = 7: f(7) = 48/(7-1) = 8
- f is decreasing, so range is [8, 24]

For gf to exist: [8, 24] ⊆ [a, b]
Therefore: **a ≤ 8** and **b ≥ 24**

Greatest value of a = **8**
Least value of b = **24**

### Part (ii) (1 mark)
**Find an expression for gf(x).**

### Solution:
gf(x) = g(f(x)) = g(48/(x-1)) = 2(48/(x-1)) - 4 = 96/(x-1) - 4

**gf(x) = 96/(x-1) - 4**

### Part (iii) (2 marks)
**Find an expression for (gf)⁻¹(x).**

### Solution:
Let y = gf(x) = 96/(x-1) - 4

Solving for x:
y + 4 = 96/(x-1)
x - 1 = 96/(y + 4)
x = 1 + 96/(y + 4) = (y + 4 + 96)/(y + 4) = (y + 100)/(y + 4)

Therefore: **(gf)⁻¹(x) = (x + 100)/(x + 4)**

## Question 5 (7 marks) - Arithmetic & Geometric Progressions
**Two boxers need to lose 13 kg each. Week 1: both lose 1 kg.**

### Part (i) (1 mark) - Boxer A (Arithmetic Progression)
**Boxer A's week 2 loss is 0.98 kg. Write down expression for total weight loss after x weeks.**

### Solution:
Arithmetic progression: a = 1, d = 0.98 - 1 = -0.02

Total after x weeks: Sₓ = (x/2)[2a + (x-1)d] = (x/2)[2(1) + (x-1)(-0.02)]
= (x/2)[2 - 0.02x + 0.02] = (x/2)[2.02 - 0.02x]

**Sₓ = x(1.01 - 0.01x)**

### Part (ii) (2 marks)
**He reaches 13 kg target during week n. Find n.**

### Solution:
Sₙ = 13
n(1.01 - 0.01n) = 13
1.01n - 0.01n² = 13
0.01n² - 1.01n + 13 = 0
n² - 101n + 1300 = 0

Using quadratic formula:
n = (101 ± √(101² - 4(1300)))/2 = (101 ± √(10201 - 5200))/2 = (101 ± √5001)/2

n = (101 ± 70.72)/2
n ≈ 85.86 or n ≈ 15.14

Since we need the smaller positive value: **n = 16** (during week 16)

### Part (iii) (4 marks) - Boxer B (Geometric Progression)
**Boxer B's week 2 loss is 0.92 kg. Calculate total after 20 weeks and show he can never reach target.**

### Solution:
Geometric progression: a = 1, r = 0.92/1 = 0.92

After 20 weeks: S₂₀ = a(1-r²⁰)/(1-r) = 1(1-0.92²⁰)/(1-0.92) = (1-0.92²⁰)/0.08

0.92²⁰ ≈ 0.1887
S₂₀ = (1-0.1887)/0.08 = 0.8113/0.08 ≈ **10.14 kg**

For infinite sum: S∞ = a/(1-r) = 1/(1-0.92) = 1/0.08 = **12.5 kg**

Since S∞ = 12.5 kg < 13 kg, **Boxer B can never reach his 13 kg target**.

## Question 6 (7 marks) - 3D Vectors
**Solid figure ABCDEF with horizontal base ABC (right-angled at A). AB = 8, AC = 4, M is midpoint of AB. D is 7 units above A. Triangle DEF is horizontal with DE∥AB, DF∥AC, FE∥CB. DE = 4, DF = 2, N is midpoint of FE.**

### Part (i) (1 mark)
**Find MF⃗ in terms of i, j, k.**

### Solution:
M = (4, 0, 0) (midpoint of AB)
D = (0, 0, 7)
F = D + DF⃗ = (0, 0, 7) + (0, 2, 0) = (0, 2, 7)

MF⃗ = F - M = (0, 2, 7) - (4, 0, 0) = **-4i + 2j + 7k**

### Part (ii) (1 mark)
**Find FN⃗ in terms of i and j.**

### Solution:
E = D + DE⃗ = (0, 0, 7) + (4, 0, 0) = (4, 0, 7)
N = midpoint of FE = ((0+4)/2, (2+0)/2, (7+7)/2) = (2, 1, 7)

FN⃗ = N - F = (2, 1, 7) - (0, 2, 7) = **2i - j**

### Part (iii) (1 mark)
**Find MN⃗ in terms of i, j, k.**

### Solution:
MN⃗ = N - M = (2, 1, 7) - (4, 0, 0) = **-2i + j + 7k**

### Part (iv) (4 marks)
**Use scalar product to find angle FMN.**

### Solution:
We need vectors MF⃗ and MN⃗:
MF⃗ = 4i - 2j - 7k (opposite of MF⃗ from part i)
MN⃗ = -2i + j + 7k

MF⃗ · MN⃗ = (4)(-2) + (-2)(1) + (-7)(7) = -8 - 2 - 49 = -59

|MF⃗| = √(4² + (-2)² + (-7)²) = √(16 + 4 + 49) = √69
|MN⃗| = √((-2)² + 1² + 7²) = √(4 + 1 + 49) = √54

cos(FMN) = (MF⃗ · MN⃗)/(|MF⃗||MN⃗|) = -59/(√69 × √54) = -59/√3726

**Angle FMN = cos⁻¹(-59/√3726) ≈ 164.2°**

## Question 7 (9 marks) - Coordinate Geometry
**Points A(1, 3) and B(9, -1). D is midpoint of AB. Point C has coordinates (x, y).**

### Part (i) (1 mark)
**State coordinates of D.**

### Solution:
D = ((1+9)/2, (3+(-1))/2) = **(5, 1)**

### Part (ii) (1 mark)
**Given CD² = 20, write down equation relating x and y.**

### Solution:
CD² = (x-5)² + (y-1)² = 20
**(x-5)² + (y-1)² = 20**

### Part (iii) (3 marks)
**Given AC and BC are equal in length, find equation and show it simplifies to y = 2x - 9.**

### Solution:
AC = BC
√[(x-1)² + (y-3)²] = √[(x-9)² + (y+1)²]
(x-1)² + (y-3)² = (x-9)² + (y+1)²
x² - 2x + 1 + y² - 6y + 9 = x² - 18x + 81 + y² + 2y + 1
-2x - 6y + 10 = -18x + 2y + 82
16x - 8y = 72
2x - y = 9
**y = 2x - 9** ✓

### Part (iv) (4 marks)
**Find possible coordinates of C.**

### Solution:
From parts (ii) and (iii):
(x-5)² + (y-1)² = 20
y = 2x - 9

Substituting: (x-5)² + (2x-9-1)² = 20
(x-5)² + (2x-10)² = 20
(x-5)² + 4(x-5)² = 20
5(x-5)² = 20
(x-5)² = 4
x-5 = ±2
x = 7 or x = 3

When x = 7: y = 2(7) - 9 = 5
When x = 3: y = 2(3) - 9 = -3

**C = (7, 5) or C = (3, -3)**

## Question 8 (8 marks) - Calculus & Stationary Points
**A curve has dy/dx = 3x² + ax + b. The curve has stationary points at (-1, 2) and (3, k).**

### Solution:
At stationary points, dy/dx = 0:
At x = -1: 3(-1)² + a(-1) + b = 0 → 3 - a + b = 0 → **a - b = 3** ... (1)
At x = 3: 3(3)² + a(3) + b = 0 → 27 + 3a + b = 0 → **3a + b = -27** ... (2)

From (2) - (1): 2a = -30 → **a = -15**
From (1): -15 - b = 3 → **b = -18**

To find k, integrate dy/dx:
y = ∫(3x² - 15x - 18)dx = x³ - 15x²/2 - 18x + c

Using point (-1, 2):
2 = (-1)³ - 15(-1)²/2 - 18(-1) + c = -1 - 15/2 + 18 + c = 9.5 + c
c = -7.5

So: y = x³ - 7.5x² - 18x - 7.5

At x = 3: k = 3³ - 7.5(3)² - 18(3) - 7.5 = 27 - 67.5 - 54 - 7.5 = **k = -102**

**a = -15, b = -18, k = -102**

## Question 9 (10 marks) - Trigonometric Functions
**Function f: x → p sin²(2x) + q for 0 ≤ x ≤ π, where p, q > 0.**

### Part (i) (2 marks)
**State the range of f in terms of p and q.**

### Solution:
sin²(2x) has range [0, 1]
Therefore f(x) = p sin²(2x) + q has range **[q, p + q]**

### Part (ii) - Number of solutions
**(a) f(x) = p + q** (1 mark)

### Solution:
p sin²(2x) + q = p + q
sin²(2x) = 1
This occurs when sin(2x) = ±1
In [0, π], 2x ∈ [0, 2π], so sin(2x) = ±1 at 2x = π/2, 3π/2
**2 solutions**

**(b) f(x) = q** (1 mark)

### Solution:
p sin²(2x) + q = q
sin²(2x) = 0
This occurs when sin(2x) = 0
In [0, π], 2x ∈ [0, 2π], so sin(2x) = 0 at 2x = 0, π, 2π
**3 solutions**

**(c) f(x) = (1/2)p + q** (1 mark)

### Solution:
p sin²(2x) + q = (1/2)p + q
sin²(2x) = 1/2
This occurs when |sin(2x)| = 1/√2
In [0, 2π], this happens 4 times
**4 solutions**

### Part (iii) (5 marks)
**For p = 3, q = 2, solve f(x) = 4.**

### Solution:
3 sin²(2x) + 2 = 4
3 sin²(2x) = 2
sin²(2x) = 2/3
sin(2x) = ±√(2/3)

For sin(2x) = √(2/3):
2x = arcsin(√(2/3)) or 2x = π - arcsin(√(2/3))
x = (1/2)arcsin(√(2/3)) or x = π/2 - (1/2)arcsin(√(2/3))

For sin(2x) = -√(2/3):
2x = π + arcsin(√(2/3)) or 2x = 2π - arcsin(√(2/3))
x = π/2 + (1/2)arcsin(√(2/3)) or x = π - (1/2)arcsin(√(2/3))

**x = 0.304, 1.267, 1.875, 2.838** (to 3 d.p.)

## Question 10 (13 marks) - Calculus & Related Rates
**Curve y = (3x + 4)^(1/2) with tangent at point A where x = 4.**

### Part (i) (5 marks)
**Find equation of tangent at A.**

### Solution:
At x = 4: y = (3(4) + 4)^(1/2) = √16 = 4
Point A = (4, 4)

dy/dx = (1/2)(3x + 4)^(-1/2) × 3 = 3/(2√(3x + 4))
At x = 4: dy/dx = 3/(2√16) = 3/8

Tangent equation: y - 4 = (3/8)(x - 4)
**y = (3/8)x + 5/2**

### Part (ii) (5 marks)
**Find area of shaded region.**

### Solution:
Shaded area = ∫₀⁴ (3x + 4)^(1/2) dx - Area of triangle

∫(3x + 4)^(1/2) dx = (1/3) × (2/3)(3x + 4)^(3/2) = (2/9)(3x + 4)^(3/2)

∫₀⁴ (3x + 4)^(1/2) dx = [(2/9)(3x + 4)^(3/2)]₀⁴
= (2/9)[16^(3/2) - 4^(3/2)] = (2/9)[64 - 8] = (2/9)(56) = 112/9

Triangle area = (1/2) × 4 × 4 = 8

**Shaded area = 112/9 - 8 = 112/9 - 72/9 = 40/9**

### Part (iii) (3 marks)
**At point P, dy/dt = (1/2)(dx/dt). Find x-coordinate of P.**

### Solution:
dy/dx = 3/(2√(3x + 4))
dy/dt = (dy/dx)(dx/dt) = [3/(2√(3x + 4))](dx/dt)

Given: dy/dt = (1/2)(dx/dt)
Therefore: [3/(2√(3x + 4))](dx/dt) = (1/2)(dx/dt)
3/(2√(3x + 4)) = 1/2
3 = √(3x + 4)
9 = 3x + 4
3x = 5
**x = 5/3**
