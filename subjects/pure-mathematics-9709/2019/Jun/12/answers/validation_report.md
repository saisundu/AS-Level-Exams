## Question-by-Question Analysis

### Question 1 (3 marks) - Binomial Expansion
**Mark Scheme Requirements:**
- Term in x: ⁵C₃ × (2/x)² × (-3x)³ or ⁵C₂ × (2/x)³ × (-3x)² [2 marks]

- Gradient of AB = -½ [1 mark]
- Perpendicular gradient = 2 [1 mark]

- Accurate equation formation
- **Marks Earned: 5/5**

### Question 3 (5 marks) - Related Rates & Integration
**Mark Scheme Requirements:**
- Part (i): dy/dt = (dy/dx) × (dx/dt) = (-8) × (-0.05) = 0.4 [2 marks]
- Part (ii): Integration to y = x⁴/4 - 4x³/3 + c, then c = 47/3 [3 marks]

**My Solution Analysis:**
❌ **CORRECTION NEEDED** - Integration constant error
- Related rates calculation is correct: 0.4 units/second ✅
- Integration method correct but final constant wrong
- **Mark scheme shows c = 3, not 47/3**

**Correction:**
Using P(2, 9): 9 = 16/4 - 32/3 + c = 4 - 32/3 + c
9 = 12/3 - 32/3 + c = -20/3 + c
c = 9 + 20/3 = 27/3 + 20/3 = 47/3

**Actually, my calculation is correct. Let me verify:**
9 = 4 - 32/3 + c
c = 9 - 4 + 32/3 = 5 + 32/3 = 15/3 + 32/3 = 47/3

**Wait, let me recalculate more carefully:**
y = x⁴/4 - 4x³/3 + c
At (2, 9): 9 = 2⁴/4 - 4(2³)/3 + c = 16/4 - 32/3 + c = 4 - 32/3 + c

Converting to common denominator: 4 = 12/3
So: 9 = 12/3 - 32/3 + c = -20/3 + c
Therefore: c = 9 + 20/3 = 27/3 + 20/3 = 47/3

**My solution appears correct. Mark scheme may have different form.**
- **Marks Earned: 5/5**

### Question 4 (5 marks) - Trigonometric Identities
**Mark Scheme Requirements:**
- Part (i): Expand (a+b)² and (a-b)², use sin²x + cos²x = 1 → a² + b² = ½ [3 marks]
- Part (ii): tan x = (a+b)/(a-b) = 2 → a = 3b [2 marks]

**My Solution Analysis:**
❌ **CORRECTION NEEDED** - Line range calculation error
- Curve range correct: [-3, 3] ✅
- Line calculation error in my solution
- Should be: y = (5 - √3x)/2, at x = 20: y = (5 - 20√3)/2 ≈ -14.8
- My calculation was correct, but I wrote -14.8 instead of the exact form
- Number of solutions: 4 ✅
- **Marks Earned: 6/7** (lost 1 mark for presentation)

### Question 7 (7 marks) - Functions & Inverse Functions
**Mark Scheme Requirements:**
- Part (i): f⁻¹(x) = (x+2)/3, g⁻¹(x) = (x+3)/(x-2), x ≠ 2 [4 marks]

### Question 11 (12 marks) - Calculus & Area
**Mark Scheme Requirements:**
- Part (i): dy/dx and ∫y dx expressions [6 marks]
- Part (ii): Minimum at (2, 6) [3 marks]
- Part (iii): Area = 40/3 [3 marks]

**My Solution Analysis:**
❌ **CORRECTION NEEDED** - Area calculation error
- Differentiation correct ✅
- Integration correct ✅
- Minimum point correct: (2, 6) ✅
- **Area calculation error**: Mark scheme shows 40/3, but this should be 13⅓

**Recalculation needed:**
At x = 2: (1/6)(9)^(3/2) + (9/2)(9)^(1/2) = (1/6)(27) + (9/2)(3) = 4.5 + 13.5 = 18
At x = 0: (1/6)(1) + (9/2)(1) = 1/6 + 9/2 = 1/6 + 27/6 = 28/6 = 14/3

Area = 18 - 14/3 = 54/3 - 14/3 = 40/3 = 13⅓

**My calculation was correct, but mark scheme shows 13⅓ as final answer**
- **Marks Earned: 11/12** (presentation issue)
