## Question 1 (3 marks) - Binomial Expansion
**Find the coefficient of x in the expansion of (2/x - 3x)⁵**

### Solution:
Using the binomial theorem: (a + b)ⁿ = Σ ⁿCᵣ aⁿ⁻ʳ bʳ

Here: a = 2/x, b = -3x, n = 5

General term: ⁵Cᵣ (2/x)⁵⁻ʳ (-3x)ʳ = ⁵Cᵣ (2)⁵⁻ʳ (x)⁻⁽⁵⁻ʳ⁾ (-3)ʳ (x)ʳ
= ⁵Cᵣ (2)⁵⁻ʳ (-3)ʳ x^(r-(5-r)) = ⁵Cᵣ (2)⁵⁻ʳ (-3)ʳ x^(2r-5)

For coefficient of x¹: 2r - 5 = 1
Therefore: 2r = 6, so r = 3

Coefficient = ⁵C₃ (2)⁵⁻³ (-3)³ = ⁵C₃ (2)² (-3)³
= 10 × 4 × (-27) = 40 × (-27) = **-1080**

## Question 2 (5 marks) - Coordinate Geometry
**Two points A and B have coordinates (1, 3) and (9, -1) respectively. The perpendicular bisector of AB intersects the y-axis at point C. Find the coordinates of C.**

### Solution:
**Step 1:** Find the midpoint of AB
Midpoint M = ((1+9)/2, (3+(-1))/2) = (5, 1)

**Step 2:** Find the gradient of AB
Gradient of AB = (-1-3)/(9-1) = -4/8 = -1/2

**Step 3:** Find the gradient of perpendicular bisector
Gradient of perpendicular bisector = -1/(-1/2) = 2

**Step 4:** Find equation of perpendicular bisector
Using point-slope form with point M(5, 1):
y - 1 = 2(x - 5)
y - 1 = 2x - 10
y = 2x - 9

**Step 5:** Find intersection with y-axis
At y-axis, x = 0:
y = 2(0) - 9 = -9

Therefore, **C = (0, -9)**

## Question 3 (5 marks) - Related Rates & Integration
**A curve is such that dy/dx = x³ - 4x². The point P(2, 9) lies on the curve.**

### Part (i) (2 marks) - Related Rates
**A point moves on the curve such that the x-coordinate is decreasing at 0.05 units per second. Find the rate of change of the y-coordinate when the point is at P.**

### Solution:
Given: dx/dt = -0.05 units/second (negative because decreasing)
At point P: x = 2

dy/dx = x³ - 4x²
At P: dy/dx = 2³ - 4(2²) = 8 - 16 = -8

Using chain rule: dy/dt = (dy/dx) × (dx/dt)
dy/dt = (-8) × (-0.05) = **0.4 units per second**

### Part (ii) (3 marks) - Integration
**Find the equation of the curve.**

### Solution:
dy/dx = x³ - 4x²

Integrating: y = ∫(x³ - 4x²)dx = x⁴/4 - 4x³/3 + c

Using point P(2, 9):
9 = (2⁴)/4 - 4(2³)/3 + c
9 = 16/4 - 32/3 + c
9 = 4 - 32/3 + c
9 = 12/3 - 32/3 + c
9 = -20/3 + c
c = 9 + 20/3 = 27/3 + 20/3 = 47/3

Therefore: **y = x⁴/4 - 4x³/3 + 47/3**

## Question 4 (5 marks) - Trigonometric Identities
**Angle x is such that sin x = a + b and cos x = a - b, where a and b are constants.**

### Part (i) (3 marks)
**Show that a² + b² has a constant value for all values of x.**

### Solution:
Using the fundamental trigonometric identity: sin²x + cos²x = 1

sin²x + cos²x = (a + b)² + (a - b)²
= a² + 2ab + b² + a² - 2ab + b²
= 2a² + 2b²
= 2(a² + b²)

Since sin²x + cos²x = 1:
2(a² + b²) = 1
Therefore: **a² + b² = 1/2** (constant)

### Part (ii) (2 marks)
**In the case where tan x = 2, express a in terms of b.**

### Solution:
tan x = sin x/cos x = (a + b)/(a - b) = 2

Therefore: a + b = 2(a - b)
a + b = 2a - 2b
a + b - 2a + 2b = 0
-a + 3b = 0
**a = 3b**

## Question 5 (5 marks) - Circle Geometry & Optimization
**A semicircle has diameter AB, centre O and radius r. Point C lies on the circumference and angle AOC = θ radians. The perimeter of sector BOC is twice the perimeter of sector AOC.**

### Solution:
**Step 1:** Express perimeters
Perimeter of sector AOC = r + r + rθ = 2r + rθ
Perimeter of sector BOC = r + r + r(π - θ) = 2r + r(π - θ)

**Step 2:** Set up equation
Perimeter of BOC = 2 × Perimeter of AOC
2r + r(π - θ) = 2(2r + rθ)
2r + rπ - rθ = 4r + 2rθ
rπ - rθ = 2r + 2rθ
rπ = 2r + 3rθ
π = 2 + 3θ
3θ = π - 2
**θ = (π - 2)/3**

**Step 3:** Calculate numerical value
θ = (3.14159 - 2)/3 = 1.14159/3 = 0.38053...

To 2 significant figures: **θ = 0.38**

## Question 6 (7 marks) - Trigonometric Functions & Graphing
**The equation of a curve is y = 3cos 2x and the equation of a line is 2y + √3x = 5.**

### Part (i) (3 marks)
**State the smallest and largest values of y for both the curve and the line for 0 ≤ x ≤ 20.**

### Solution:
**For the curve y = 3cos 2x:**
- Range of cos 2x is [-1, 1]
- Therefore range of y is [-3, 3]
- Smallest value: **-3**
- Largest value: **3**

**For the line 2y + √3x = 5:**
Rearranging: y = (5 - √3x)/2 = 2.5 - (√3/2)x

At x = 0: y = 2.5
At x = 20: y = 2.5 - (√3/2)(20) = 2.5 - 10√3 ≈ 2.5 - 17.32 = -14.82

- Smallest value: **-14.8** (at x = 20)
- Largest value: **2.5** (at x = 0)

### Part (ii) (3 marks)
**Sketch both graphs for 0 ≤ x ≤ 20.**

### Solution:
[Graph would show:
- y = 3cos 2x: oscillating between -3 and 3 with period π
- 2y + √3x = 5: straight line from (0, 2.5) to (20, -14.8)]

### Part (iii) (1 mark)
**State the number of solutions of 6cos 2x = 5 - √3x for 0 ≤ x ≤ 20.**

### Solution:
This is equivalent to finding intersections of y = 3cos 2x and y = (5 - √3x)/2.
From the sketch, counting intersection points: **4 solutions**

## Question 7 (7 marks) - Functions & Inverse Functions
**Functions f and g are defined by:**
**f: x → 3x - 2, x ∈ ℝ**
**g: x → (2x + 3)/(x - 1), x ∈ ℝ, x ≠ 1**

### Part (i) (4 marks)
**Obtain expressions for f⁻¹(x) and g⁻¹(x), stating the value of x for which g⁻¹(x) is not defined.**

### Solution:
**For f⁻¹(x):**
Let y = 3x - 2
x = 3y - 2
3y = x + 2
y = (x + 2)/3

Therefore: **f⁻¹(x) = (x + 2)/3**

**For g⁻¹(x):**
Let y = (2x + 3)/(x - 1)
y(x - 1) = 2x + 3
yx - y = 2x + 3
yx - 2x = y + 3
x(y - 2) = y + 3
x = (y + 3)/(y - 2)

Therefore: **g⁻¹(x) = (x + 3)/(x - 2)**

g⁻¹(x) is not defined when x - 2 = 0, so **x = 2**

### Part (ii) (3 marks)
**Solve the equation fg(x) = 7/3.**

### Solution:
fg(x) = f(g(x)) = f((2x + 3)/(x - 1))
= 3((2x + 3)/(x - 1)) - 2
= (3(2x + 3))/(x - 1) - 2
= (6x + 9)/(x - 1) - 2
= (6x + 9 - 2(x - 1))/(x - 1)
= (6x + 9 - 2x + 2)/(x - 1)
= (4x + 11)/(x - 1)

Setting equal to 7/3:
(4x + 11)/(x - 1) = 7/3
3(4x + 11) = 7(x - 1)
12x + 33 = 7x - 7
5x = -40
**x = -8**

## Question 8 (8 marks) - 3D Vectors
**Position vectors of points A and B are OA = (6, -2, -6) and OB = (3, k, -3), where k is a constant.**

### Part (i) (2 marks)
**Find the value of k for which angle AOB is 90°.**

### Solution:
For perpendicular vectors: OA · OB = 0

OA · OB = (6)(3) + (-2)(k) + (-6)(-3)
= 18 - 2k + 18
= 36 - 2k

Setting equal to 0:
36 - 2k = 0
2k = 36
**k = 18**

### Part (ii) (2 marks)
**Find the values of k for which the lengths of OA and OB are equal.**

### Solution:
|OA| = √(6² + (-2)² + (-6)²) = √(36 + 4 + 36) = √76

|OB| = √(3² + k² + (-3)²) = √(9 + k² + 9) = √(18 + k²)

Setting equal:
√76 = √(18 + k²)
76 = 18 + k²
k² = 58
**k = ±√58**

### Part (iii) (4 marks)
**Point C is such that AC = 2CB. In the case where k = 4, find the unit vector in the direction of OC.**

### Solution:
With k = 4: OB = (3, 4, -3)

Using AC = 2CB:
OC - OA = 2(OB - OC)
OC - OA = 2OB - 2OC
3OC = OA + 2OB
OC = (1/3)(OA + 2OB)
= (1/3)((6, -2, -6) + 2(3, 4, -3))
= (1/3)((6, -2, -6) + (6, 8, -6))
= (1/3)(12, 6, -12)
= (4, 2, -4)

|OC| = √(4² + 2² + (-4)²) = √(16 + 4 + 16) = √36 = 6

Unit vector = OC/|OC| = (4, 2, -4)/6 = **(2/3, 1/3, -2/3)**

## Question 9 (8 marks) - Curve Tangency
**Curve C₁: y = x² - 4x + 7. Curve C₂: y² = 4x + k. The tangent to C₁ at x = 3 is also tangent to C₂ at point P.**

### Solution:
**Step 1:** Find tangent to C₁ at x = 3
At x = 3: y = 3² - 4(3) + 7 = 9 - 12 + 7 = 4
Point on C₁: (3, 4)

dy/dx = 2x - 4
At x = 3: dy/dx = 2(3) - 4 = 2

Tangent equation: y - 4 = 2(x - 3)
y = 2x - 2

**Step 2:** Find where this tangent touches C₂
For C₂: y² = 4x + k
Differentiating implicitly: 2y(dy/dx) = 4
dy/dx = 2/y

At point P, the gradient is 2:
2/y = 2
y = 1

**Step 3:** Find x-coordinate of P
Since P lies on the tangent y = 2x - 2:
1 = 2x - 2
2x = 3
x = 3/2

**Step 4:** Find k
Point P(3/2, 1) lies on C₂:
1² = 4(3/2) + k
1 = 6 + k
**k = -5**

Therefore: **k = -5** and **P = (3/2, 1)**

## Question 10 (10 marks) - Arithmetic & Geometric Progressions

### Part (a) - Arithmetic Progression

#### Part (i) (4 marks)
**In an AP, sum of first 10 terms equals sum of next 5 terms. First term is a. Show that common difference is a/3.**

### Solution:
Let common difference = d

Sum of first 10 terms: S₁₀ = (10/2)(2a + 9d) = 5(2a + 9d) = 10a + 45d

Sum of next 5 terms (terms 11-15):
= Sum of first 15 terms - Sum of first 10 terms
= (15/2)(2a + 14d) - (10a + 45d)
= 15a + 105d - 10a - 45d
= 5a + 60d

Given: S₁₀ = Sum of next 5 terms
10a + 45d = 5a + 60d
5a = 15d
**d = a/3** ✓

#### Part (ii) (2 marks)
**Given that the 10th term is 36 more than the 4th term, find the value of a.**

### Solution:
T₁₀ = a + 9d, T₄ = a + 3d
T₁₀ - T₄ = 36
(a + 9d) - (a + 3d) = 36
6d = 36
d = 6

Since d = a/3:
6 = a/3
**a = 18**

### Part (b) (4 marks) - Geometric Progression
**Sum to infinity is 9 times sum of first 4 terms. First term is 12. Find the 5th term.**

### Solution:
Let common ratio = r

S∞ = a/(1-r) = 12/(1-r)
S₄ = a(1-r⁴)/(1-r) = 12(1-r⁴)/(1-r)

Given: S∞ = 9S₄
12/(1-r) = 9 × 12(1-r⁴)/(1-r)
1 = 9(1-r⁴)
1 = 9 - 9r⁴
9r⁴ = 8
r⁴ = 8/9
r = ±(8/9)^(1/4)

Since we need convergence: |r| < 1, so r = (8/9)^(1/4)

5th term = ar⁴ = 12 × (8/9) = **32/3**

## Question 11 (12 marks) - Calculus & Area
**Curve: y = √(4x + 1) + 9/√(4x + 1)**

### Part (i) (6 marks)
**Find expressions for dy/dx and ∫y dx.**

### Solution:
**For dy/dx:**
y = (4x + 1)^(1/2) + 9(4x + 1)^(-1/2)

dy/dx = (1/2)(4x + 1)^(-1/2) × 4 + 9(-1/2)(4x + 1)^(-3/2) × 4
= 2(4x + 1)^(-1/2) - 18(4x + 1)^(-3/2)
= 2/√(4x + 1) - 18/(4x + 1)^(3/2)

**dy/dx = (2(4x + 1) - 18)/(4x + 1)^(3/2) = (8x - 16)/(4x + 1)^(3/2)**

**For ∫y dx:**
∫y dx = ∫[(4x + 1)^(1/2) + 9(4x + 1)^(-1/2)] dx

= (1/4) × (2/3)(4x + 1)^(3/2) + 9 × (1/4) × 2(4x + 1)^(1/2) + c
= (1/6)(4x + 1)^(3/2) + (9/2)(4x + 1)^(1/2) + c

**∫y dx = (1/6)(4x + 1)^(3/2) + (9/2)(4x + 1)^(1/2) + c**

### Part (ii) (3 marks)
**Find the coordinates of minimum point M.**

### Solution:
At minimum: dy/dx = 0
(8x - 16)/(4x + 1)^(3/2) = 0
8x - 16 = 0
x = 2

At x = 2: y = √(4(2) + 1) + 9/√(4(2) + 1) = √9 + 9/√9 = 3 + 3 = 6

**M = (2, 6)**

### Part (iii) (3 marks)
**Find the area of the shaded region bounded by the curve, y-axis, and horizontal line through M.**

### Solution:
Area = ∫₀² y dx = ∫₀² [√(4x + 1) + 9/√(4x + 1)] dx

Using the result from part (i):
= [(1/6)(4x + 1)^(3/2) + (9/2)(4x + 1)^(1/2)]₀²

At x = 2: (1/6)(9)^(3/2) + (9/2)(9)^(1/2) = (1/6)(27) + (9/2)(3) = 4.5 + 13.5 = 18
At x = 0: (1/6)(1)^(3/2) + (9/2)(1)^(1/2) = 1/6 + 9/2 = 1/6 + 27/6 = 28/6 = 14/3

Area = 18 - 14/3 = 54/3 - 14/3 = **40/3**
