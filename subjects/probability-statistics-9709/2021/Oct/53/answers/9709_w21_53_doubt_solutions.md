## Question 5: Security Code Combinatorics and Probability

**Context**: Security codes consist of 2 letters followed by a 4-digit number. Letters chosen from {A, B, C, D, E} and digits from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. No letter or digit may appear more than once. Example: BE3216.

### Part (a): Total number of different codes

**Problem**: How many different codes can be formed?

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Count arrangements for letters
We need to choose 2 letters from 5 available letters {A, B, C, D, E} where order matters and no repetition is allowed.

Number of ways = P(5,2) = 5 × 4 = **20**

**Step 2**: Count arrangements for digits  
We need to choose 4 digits from 7 available digits {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} where order matters and no repetition is allowed.

Number of ways = P(7,4) = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 = **840**

**Step 3**: Apply multiplication principle
Total codes = (ways to arrange letters) × (ways to arrange digits)
= 20 × 840 = **16,800**

### Part (b): Codes including letter A or digit 5 or both

**Problem**: Find the number of different codes that include the letter A or the digit 5 or both.

**Solution**:

I'll use the inclusion-exclusion principle: |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|

**Step 1**: Codes with letter A
When A is included, we need:
- 1 more letter from {B, C, D, E}: 4 choices for first position, then position matters
- Letter arrangements: 4 × 1 × 2 = 8 ways (A can be in position 1 or 2)
- Digit arrangements: P(7,4) = 840 ways
- Total with A: 8 × 840 = **6,720**

**Step 2**: Codes with digit 5
When 5 is included, we need:
- Letter arrangements: P(5,2) = 20 ways
- 3 more digits from {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}: arrangements with 5 in any of 4 positions
- Digit arrangements: 6 × 5 × 4 × 4 = 480 ways (5 can be in any position)
- Total with 5: 20 × 480 = **9,600**

**Step 3**: Codes with both A and 5
When both A and 5 are included:
- Letter arrangements: 4 × 1 × 2 = 8 ways (A in either position)
- Digit arrangements: 6 × 5 × 4 × 4 = 480 ways (5 in any position)
- Total with both: 8 × 480 = **3,840**

**Step 4**: Apply inclusion-exclusion
Total = 6,720 + 9,600 - 3,840 = **12,480**

### Part (c): Probability of specific code format

**Problem**: Find the probability that a randomly formed code is DE followed by a number between 4500 and 5000.

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Identify the constraints
- Letters must be exactly "DE"
- Number must be between 4500 and 5000 (4-digit number starting with 4)
- The number must be of form 4_ _ _ where digits don't repeat

**Step 2**: Count favorable outcomes
**Letters**: Only 1 way to get "DE"

**Numbers**: Form 4ABC where A, B, C are chosen from {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7} (can't use 4 again)
- For numbers 4500-5000: first digit = 4, remaining digits from {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- We need 4_ _ _ where the number ≥ 4500

**Step 3**: Analyze the digit constraints more carefully
Numbers between 4500 and 5000:
- Must start with 4
- Second digit must be 5, 6, or 7 to be ≥ 4500
- If second digit is 5: 45_ _ (remaining from {1, 2, 3, 6, 7})
- If second digit is 6: 46_ _ (remaining from {1, 2, 3, 5, 7})  
- If second digit is 7: 47_ _ (remaining from {1, 2, 3, 5, 6})

Wait, let me reconsider this. The number just needs to be between 4500 and 5000.

**Corrected Step 3**: Count valid 4-digit numbers
For 4-digit numbers starting with 4 and between 4500-5000:
- 4500-4999 are valid (but we can't have 5000 since that would need digit 0)
- Pattern: 4XYZ where X ∈ {5, 6, 7} and Y, Z chosen from remaining digits

Case 1: 45YZ where Y, Z ∈ {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}, Y ≠ Z
Number of ways = 5 × 4 = 20

Case 2: 46YZ where Y, Z ∈ {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}, Y ≠ Z  
Number of ways = 5 × 4 = 20

Case 3: 47YZ where Y, Z ∈ {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}, Y ≠ Z
Number of ways = 5 × 4 = 20

Total valid numbers = 20 + 20 + 20 = **60**

**Step 4**: Calculate probability
Total favorable outcomes = 1 × 60 = 60
Total possible outcomes = 16,800

Probability = 60/16,800 = 1/280 = **0.00357**
