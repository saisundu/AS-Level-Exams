## Question 1 (2 marks)
**Topic:** Combinations

The 26 members of the local sports club include Mr and Mrs Khan and their son Abad. The club is holding a party to celebrate Abad's birthday, but there is only room for 20 people to attend. In how many ways can the 20 people be chosen from the 26 members of the club, given that Mr and Mrs Khan and Abad must be included?

**Solution:**
Since Mr and Mrs Khan and Abad must be included, we need to choose the remaining 17 people from the remaining 23 members.

Number of ways = C(23, 17) = C(23, 6) = 23!/(6! × 17!)
                = (23 × 22 × 21 × 20 × 19 × 18)/(6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)
                = 100,947

**Answer: 100,947**

```

**Answer: Back-to-back stem-and-leaf diagram shown above**

### Part (b) (2 marks)
Find the interquartile range of the distances thrown by the 11 pupils at Lakeview school.

**Solution:**
Lakeview data (ordered): 10, 14, 19, 22, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 33, 41

For n = 11:
- Q₁ position = (11+1)/4 = 3rd value = 19 m
- Q₃ position = 3(11+1)/4 = 9th value = 32 m

IQR = Q₃ - Q₁ = 32 - 19 = 13 m

**Answer: IQR = 13 m**

| Class | Class Width | Frequency | Frequency Density |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 0-5   | 5           | 23        | 23/5 = 4.6       |
| 5-10  | 5           | 102       | 102/5 = 20.4     |
| 10-20 | 10          | 135       | 135/10 = 13.5    |
| 20-30 | 10          | 76        | 76/10 = 7.6      |
| 30-50 | 20          | 24        | 24/20 = 1.2      |

**Answer: Histogram drawn with frequency densities: 4.6, 20.4, 13.5, 7.6, 1.2**

### Part (b) (2 marks)
Calculate an estimate of the mean time taken by an employee to travel to work.

**Solution:**
Using midpoints:

| Class | Midpoint | Frequency | fx |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----|
| 0-5   | 2.5      | 23        | 57.5 |
| 5-10  | 7.5      | 102       | 765 |
| 10-20 | 15       | 135       | 2025 |
| 20-30 | 25       | 76        | 1900 |
| 30-50 | 40       | 24        | 960 |
| Total |          | 360       | 5707.5 |

Mean = Σfx / Σf = 5707.5 / 360 = 15.9 minutes

**Answer: 15.9 minutes**

## Question 4 (8 marks)
**Topic:** Normal Distribution

Raj's running times have a normal distribution with mean 41.2 minutes and standard deviation 3.6 minutes.

### Part (a) (3 marks)
Find the probability that on a randomly chosen day Raj runs for more than 43.2 minutes.

**Solution:**
Let X ~ N(41.2, 3.6²)

P(X > 43.2) = P(Z > (43.2 - 41.2)/3.6) = P(Z > 2.0/3.6) = P(Z > 0.556)

From normal tables: Φ(0.556) ≈ 0.711

P(X > 43.2) = 1 - 0.711 = 0.289

**Answer: 0.289**

### Part (b) (2 marks)
Find an estimate for the number of days in a year (365 days) on which Raj runs for less than 43.2 minutes.

**Solution:**
P(X < 43.2) = 1 - P(X > 43.2) = 1 - 0.289 = 0.711

Expected number of days = 365 × 0.711 = 259.5

**Answer: 260 days**

### Part (c) (3 marks)
On 95% of days, Raj runs for more than t minutes. Find the value of t.

**Solution:**
P(X > t) = 0.95
P(X ≤ t) = 0.05

From normal tables: Φ⁻¹(0.05) = -1.645

Standardizing: (t - 41.2)/3.6 = -1.645
t - 41.2 = 3.6 × (-1.645)
t = 41.2 - 5.922
t = 35.3

**Answer: t = 35.3 minutes**

## Question 5 (8 marks)
**Topic:** Permutations and Combinations

A security code consists of 2 letters followed by a 4-digit number. The letters are chosen from {A, B, C, D, E} and the digits are chosen from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. No letter or digit may appear more than once.

### Part (a) (2 marks)
How many different codes can be formed?

**Solution:**
Letters: Choose 2 from 5 letters without repetition = P(5,2) = 5 × 4 = 20
Digits: Choose 4 from 7 digits without repetition = P(7,4) = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 = 840

Total codes = 20 × 840 = 16,800

**Answer: 16,800**

### Part (b) (3 marks)
Find the number of different codes that include the letter A or the digit 5 or both.

**Solution:**
Using complementary counting:
Total codes = 16,800

Codes with neither A nor 5:
- Letters without A: P(4,2) = 4 × 3 = 12
- Digits without 5: P(6,4) = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 = 360
- Codes without A or 5 = 12 × 360 = 4,320

Codes with A or 5 or both = 16,800 - 4,320 = 12,480

**Answer: 12,480**

### Part (c) (3 marks)
Find the probability that the code is DE followed by a number between 4500 and 5000.

**Solution:**
For code to be DE followed by a number between 4500 and 5000:

Letters: Must be DE (1 way)

Numbers between 4500 and 5000 using digits {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} without repetition:
- Must start with 4
- Second digit must be 5, 6, or 7 (3 choices)
- Third digit: 2 remaining choices from unused digits
- Fourth digit: 1 remaining choice

But we need numbers ≥ 4500, so second digit must be ≥ 5:
- 45__ : Third digit from {1,2,3,6,7} (5 choices), fourth digit (4 choices) = 20 numbers
- 46__ : Third digit from {1,2,3,5,7} (5 choices), fourth digit (4 choices) = 20 numbers  
- 47__ : Third digit from {1,2,3,5,6} (5 choices), fourth digit (4 choices) = 20 numbers

Total valid numbers = 20 + 20 + 20 = 60

Probability = (1 × 60) / 16,800 = 60/16,800 = 1/280

**Answer: 1/280**

## Question 6 (10 marks)
**Topic:** Probability Distributions

Jim throws three darts at a board. The random variable X is the number of darts that hit the bull's-eye.

| x | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P(X=x) | 0.6 | p | q | 0.05 |

Given that E(X) = 0.55.

### Part (a) (4 marks)
Find the values of p and q.

**Solution:**
Since probabilities sum to 1:
0.6 + p + q + 0.05 = 1
p + q = 0.35 ... (1)

Using E(X) = 0.55:
E(X) = 0×0.6 + 1×p + 2×q + 3×0.05
0.55 = p + 2q + 0.15
p + 2q = 0.40 ... (2)

From (2) - (1): q = 0.05
From (1): p = 0.35 - 0.05 = 0.30

**Answer: p = 0.30, q = 0.05**

### Part (b) (2 marks)
Find Var(X).

**Solution:**
E(X²) = 0²×0.6 + 1²×0.30 + 2²×0.05 + 3²×0.05
      = 0 + 0.30 + 0.20 + 0.45
      = 0.95

Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]²
       = 0.95 - (0.55)²
       = 0.95 - 0.3025
       = 0.6475

**Answer: Var(X) = 0.6475**

### Part (c) (3 marks)
Find the probability that X = 1 in at least 3 of 12 randomly chosen turns.

**Solution:**
Let Y = number of turns where X = 1 out of 12 turns
Y ~ B(12, 0.30)

P(Y ≥ 3) = 1 - P(Y ≤ 2) = 1 - [P(Y=0) + P(Y=1) + P(Y=2)]

P(Y=0) = C(12,0) × (0.30)⁰ × (0.70)¹² = (0.70)¹² = 0.0138
P(Y=1) = C(12,1) × (0.30)¹ × (0.70)¹¹ = 12 × 0.30 × 0.0197 = 0.0712
P(Y=2) = C(12,2) × (0.30)² × (0.70)¹⁰ = 66 × 0.09 × 0.0282 = 0.1678

P(Y ≥ 3) = 1 - (0.0138 + 0.0712 + 0.1678) = 1 - 0.2528 = 0.747

**Answer: 0.747**

### Part (d) (1 mark)
Find the probability that Jim first succeeds in hitting the bull's-eye with all three darts on his 9th turn.

**Solution:**
This follows a geometric distribution.
P(X = 3) = 0.05 (probability of success)
P(first success on 9th turn) = (1 - 0.05)⁸ × 0.05 = (0.95)⁸ × 0.05

(0.95)⁸ = 0.6634
P = 0.6634 × 0.05 = 0.0332

**Answer: 0.0332**

## Question 7 (10 marks)
**Topic:** Conditional Probability and Tree Diagrams

Box A contains 6 red balls and 4 blue balls. Box B contains x red balls and 9 blue balls.

### Part (a) (3 marks)
Complete the tree diagram, giving the remaining four probabilities in terms of x.

**Solution:**
From Box A: P(Red) = 6/10, P(Blue) = 4/10

After transferring from A to B, Box B has (x+1) red and 9 blue balls if red transferred, or x red and 10 blue balls if blue transferred.

Tree diagram probabilities:
- A: Red (6/10) → B: Red = (x+1)/(x+10)
- A: Red (6/10) → B: Blue = 9/(x+10)
- A: Blue (4/10) → B: Red = x/(x+10)
- A: Blue (4/10) → B: Blue = 10/(x+10)

**Answer: (x+1)/(x+10), 9/(x+10), x/(x+10), 10/(x+10)**

### Part (b) (2 marks)
Show that the probability that both balls chosen are blue is 4/(x+10).

**Solution:**
P(both blue) = P(A: Blue) × P(B: Blue | A: Blue)
             = (4/10) × (10/(x+10))
             = 40/(10(x+10))
             = 4/(x+10) ✓

**Answer: Shown that P(both blue) = 4/(x+10)**

### Part (c) (5 marks)
Given that P(both blue) = 1/6, find the probability that the ball chosen from box A is red given that the ball chosen from box B is red.

**Solution:**
From P(both blue) = 1/6:
4/(x+10) = 1/6
24 = x + 10
x = 14

So Box B originally contains 14 red balls and 9 blue balls.

Now find P(A: Red | B: Red):

P(B: Red) = P(A: Red) × P(B: Red | A: Red) + P(A: Blue) × P(B: Red | A: Blue)
          = (6/10) × (15/24) + (4/10) × (14/24)
          = (6×15 + 4×14)/(10×24)
          = (90 + 56)/240
          = 146/240
          = 73/120

P(A: Red ∩ B: Red) = (6/10) × (15/24) = 90/240 = 3/8

P(A: Red | B: Red) = P(A: Red ∩ B: Red) / P(B: Red)
                   = (3/8) / (73/120)
                   = (3/8) × (120/73)
                   = 360/584
                   = 45/73
                   ≈ 0.616

**Answer: 0.616**
