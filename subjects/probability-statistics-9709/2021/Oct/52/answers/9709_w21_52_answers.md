## Question 1 (5 marks)
**Topic:** Conditional Probability and Independence

Each of the 180 students at a college plays exactly one of the piano, the guitar and the drums. The numbers are given in the table:

|        | Piano | Guitar | Drums | Total |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| Male   | 25    | 44     | 11    | 80    |
| Female | 42    | 38     | 20    | 100   |
| Total  | 67    | 82     | 31    | 180   |

### Part (a) (1 mark)
Find the probability that the student plays the guitar.

**Solution:**
Total students who play guitar = 44 + 38 = 82
Total students = 180

P(Guitar) = 82/180 = 41/90

**Answer: 41/90**

### Part (b) (2 marks)
Find the probability that the student is male given that the student plays the drums.

**Solution:**
This is a conditional probability problem.

P(Male|Drums) = P(Male ∩ Drums) / P(Drums)

Number of male students who play drums = 11
Total students who play drums = 11 + 20 = 31

P(Male|Drums) = 11/31

**Answer: 11/31**

### Part (c) (2 marks)
Determine whether the events 'the student plays the guitar' and 'the student is female' are independent, justifying your answer.

**Solution:**
For independence, we need P(Guitar ∩ Female) = P(Guitar) × P(Female)

P(Guitar) = 82/180 = 41/90
P(Female) = 100/180 = 5/9
P(Guitar ∩ Female) = 38/180 = 19/90

Check: P(Guitar) × P(Female) = (41/90) × (5/9) = 205/810 = 41/162

P(Guitar ∩ Female) = 19/90 = 171/810

Since 205/810 ≠ 171/810, the events are NOT independent.

**Answer: Not independent**

## Question 2 (5 marks)
**Topic:** Combinations

A group of 6 people is to be chosen from 4 men and 11 women.

### Part (a) (2 marks)
In how many different ways can a group of 6 be chosen if it must contain exactly 1 man?

**Solution:**
Choose 1 man from 4 men: C(4,1) = 4
Choose 5 women from 11 women: C(11,5) = 462

Total ways = C(4,1) × C(11,5) = 4 × 462 = 1848

**Answer: 1848**

### Part (b) (3 marks)
Two of the 11 women are sisters Jane and Kate. In how many different ways can a group of 6 be chosen if Jane and Kate cannot both be in the group?

**Solution:**
Total ways to choose 6 from 15 people = C(15,6) = 5005

Ways where both Jane and Kate are in the group:
- Choose Jane and Kate (2 people)
- Choose 4 more from remaining 13 people = C(13,4) = 715

Ways where Jane and Kate cannot both be in the group = 5005 - 715 = 4290

**Answer: 4290**

## Question 3 (7 marks)
**Topic:** Hypergeometric Distribution

A bag contains 5 yellow and 4 green marbles. Three marbles are selected at random from the bag, without replacement.

### Part (a) (3 marks)
Show that the probability that exactly one of the marbles is yellow is 5/14.

**Solution:**
Total marbles = 5 + 4 = 9
Selecting 3 marbles without replacement.

P(exactly 1 yellow) = P(1 yellow, 2 green)

Number of ways to choose 1 yellow from 5: C(5,1) = 5
Number of ways to choose 2 green from 4: C(4,2) = 6
Total ways to choose 3 from 9: C(9,3) = 84

P(exactly 1 yellow) = (C(5,1) × C(4,2)) / C(9,3) = (5 × 6) / 84 = 30/84 = 5/14 ✓

**Answer: Shown that P(exactly 1 yellow) = 5/14**

### Part (b) (3 marks)
The random variable X is the number of yellow marbles selected. Draw up the probability distribution table for X.

**Solution:**
X can take values 0, 1, 2, 3

P(X = 0) = C(5,0) × C(4,3) / C(9,3) = 1 × 4 / 84 = 4/84 = 1/21

P(X = 1) = 5/14 (from part a)

P(X = 2) = C(5,2) × C(4,1) / C(9,3) = 10 × 4 / 84 = 40/84 = 10/21

P(X = 3) = C(5,3) × C(4,0) / C(9,3) = 10 × 1 / 84 = 10/84 = 5/42

**Probability Distribution Table:**
| X | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P(X) | 1/21 | 5/14 | 10/21 | 5/42 |

**Answer: Table shown above**

### Part (c) (1 mark)
Find E(X).

**Solution:**
E(X) = 0 × (1/21) + 1 × (5/14) + 2 × (10/21) + 3 × (5/42)
     = 0 + 5/14 + 20/21 + 15/42

Converting to common denominator (42):
= 0 + 15/42 + 40/42 + 15/42
= 70/42 = 5/3

**Answer: E(X) = 5/3**

## Question 4 (6 marks)
**Topic:** Arrangements with Constraints

### Part (a) (2 marks)
In how many different ways can the 9 letters of the word TELESCOPE be arranged?

**Solution:**
TELESCOPE has 9 letters: T(1), E(3), L(1), S(1), C(1), O(1), P(1)

Number of arrangements = 9! / 3! = 362880 / 6 = 60480

**Answer: 60,480**

### Part (b) (4 marks)
In how many different ways can the 9 letters of the word TELESCOPE be arranged so that there are exactly two letters between the T and the C?

**Solution:**
We need exactly 2 letters between T and C, so the pattern is either:
T _ _ C or C _ _ T

Method:
1. Choose positions for T and C with exactly 2 letters between them
2. Arrange the remaining 7 letters in the remaining 7 positions

Possible positions for T and C:
- Positions (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), (4,7), (5,8), (6,9) for T _ _ C
- Positions (4,1), (5,2), (6,3), (7,4), (8,5), (9,6) for C _ _ T

Total: 12 ways to place T and C

For each placement, arrange the remaining 7 letters (E,E,E,L,S,O,P):
Number of arrangements = 7! / 3! = 5040 / 6 = 840

Total arrangements = 12 × 840 = 10,080

**Answer: 10,080**

## Question 5 (7 marks)
**Topic:** Binomial and Geometric Distributions

In a certain region, the probability that any given day in October is wet is 0.16, independently of other days.

### Part (a) (3 marks)
Find the probability that, in a 10-day period in October, fewer than 3 days will be wet.

**Solution:**
Let X ~ B(10, 0.16)

P(X < 3) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)

P(X = 0) = C(10,0) × (0.16)⁰ × (0.84)¹⁰ = 1 × 1 × 0.1749 = 0.1749
P(X = 1) = C(10,1) × (0.16)¹ × (0.84)⁹ = 10 × 0.16 × 0.2082 = 0.3331
P(X = 2) = C(10,2) × (0.16)² × (0.84)⁸ = 45 × 0.0256 × 0.2479 = 0.2856

P(X < 3) = 0.1749 + 0.3331 + 0.2856 = 0.794

**Answer: 0.794**

### Part (b) (2 marks)
Find the probability that the first wet day in October is 8 October.

**Solution:**
This follows a geometric distribution.
The first wet day is 8 October means the first 7 days are dry and the 8th day is wet.

P(first wet day is 8 October) = (0.84)⁷ × (0.16)
                                = 0.2951 × 0.16
                                = 0.0472

**Answer: 0.0472**

### Part (c) (2 marks)
For 4 randomly chosen years, find the probability that in exactly 1 of these years the first wet day in October is 8 October.

**Solution:**
Let Y ~ B(4, 0.0472) where p = 0.0472 from part (b)

P(Y = 1) = C(4,1) × (0.0472)¹ × (0.9528)³
         = 4 × 0.0472 × 0.8651
         = 0.163

**Answer: 0.163**

## Question 6 (10 marks)
**Topic:** Normal Distribution

The times taken, in minutes, to complete a particular task by employees at a large company are normally distributed with mean 32.2 and standard deviation 9.6.

### Part (a) (3 marks)
Find the probability that a randomly chosen employee takes more than 28.6 minutes to complete the task.

**Solution:**
Let X ~ N(32.2, 9.6²)

P(X > 28.6) = P(Z > (28.6 - 32.2)/9.6) = P(Z > -3.6/9.6) = P(Z > -0.375)

P(Z > -0.375) = 1 - Φ(-0.375) = Φ(0.375)

From normal tables: Φ(0.375) ≈ 0.646

**Answer: 0.646**

### Part (b) (3 marks)
20% of employees take longer than t minutes to complete the task. Find the value of t.

**Solution:**
P(X > t) = 0.20
P(X ≤ t) = 0.80

From normal tables: Φ⁻¹(0.80) = 0.842

Standardizing: (t - 32.2)/9.6 = 0.842
t - 32.2 = 9.6 × 0.842
t = 32.2 + 8.08
t = 40.3

**Answer: t = 40.3 minutes**

### Part (c) (4 marks)
Find the probability that the time taken to complete the task by a randomly chosen employee differs from the mean by less than 15.0 minutes.

**Solution:**
We need P(|X - 32.2| < 15.0) = P(-15.0 < X - 32.2 < 15.0)
                                = P(17.2 < X < 47.2)

Standardizing:
For X = 17.2: Z = (17.2 - 32.2)/9.6 = -15.0/9.6 = -1.563
For X = 47.2: Z = (47.2 - 32.2)/9.6 = 15.0/9.6 = 1.563

P(17.2 < X < 47.2) = P(-1.563 < Z < 1.563)
                    = Φ(1.563) - Φ(-1.563)
                    = Φ(1.563) - [1 - Φ(1.563)]
                    = 2Φ(1.563) - 1

From normal tables: Φ(1.563) ≈ 0.941

P(17.2 < X < 47.2) = 2(0.941) - 1 = 0.882

**Answer: 0.882**

## Question 7 (10 marks)
**Topic:** Cumulative Frequency and Statistics

The distances, x m, travelled to school by 140 children were recorded with cumulative frequencies:

| Distance, x m | x ≤ 200 | x ≤ 300 | x ≤ 500 | x ≤ 900 | x ≤ 1200 | x ≤ 1600 |
|---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| Cumulative frequency | 16 | 46 | 88 | 122 | 134 | 140 |

### Part (a) (2 marks)
On the grid, draw a cumulative frequency graph to represent these results.

**Solution:**
Plot points: (200, 16), (300, 46), (500, 88), (900, 122), (1200, 134), (1600, 140)
Connect with a smooth curve.

**Answer: Cumulative frequency graph drawn**

### Part (b) (2 marks)
Use your graph to estimate the interquartile range of the distances.

**Solution:**
Q₁ position = 140/4 = 35th value
Q₃ position = 3×140/4 = 105th value

From the graph:
Q₁ ≈ 280 m (when cumulative frequency = 35)
Q₃ ≈ 750 m (when cumulative frequency = 105)

IQR = Q₃ - Q₁ = 750 - 280 = 470 m

**Answer: IQR ≈ 470 m**

### Part (c) (6 marks)
Calculate estimates of the mean and standard deviation of the distances.

**Solution:**
First, convert to frequency table using class midpoints:

| Class | Midpoint | Frequency | fx | fx² |
|-------|----------|-----------|----|----- |
| 0-200 | 100 | 16 | 1600 | 160000 |
| 200-300 | 250 | 30 | 7500 | 1875000 |
| 300-500 | 400 | 42 | 16800 | 6720000 |
| 500-900 | 700 | 34 | 23800 | 16660000 |
| 900-1200 | 1050 | 12 | 12600 | 13230000 |
| 1200-1600 | 1400 | 6 | 8400 | 11760000 |
| Total | | 140 | 70700 | 50405000 |

Mean = Σfx / Σf = 70700 / 140 = 505 m

Variance = Σfx² / Σf - (mean)²
         = 50405000 / 140 - (505)²
         = 360036 - 255025
         = 105011

Standard deviation = √105011 = 324 m

**Answer: Mean = 505 m, Standard deviation = 324 m**
