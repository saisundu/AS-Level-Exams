## Question 1 (4 marks)
**Topic:** Geometric Distribution

Two fair coins are thrown at the same time. The random variable X is the number of throws of the two coins required to obtain two tails at the same time.

### Part (a) (2 marks)
Find the probability that two tails are obtained for the first time on the 7th throw.

**Solution:**
This follows a geometric distribution.

Probability of getting two tails on any single throw = P(TT) = (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4

For geometric distribution, P(X = k) = (1-p)^(k-1) × p

P(X = 7) = (1 - 1/4)^(7-1) × (1/4)
         = (3/4)^6 × (1/4)
         = (729/4096) × (1/4)
         = 729/16384

**Answer: 729/16384 ≈ 0.0445**

### Part (b) (2 marks)
Find the probability that it takes more than 9 throws to obtain two tails for the first time.

**Solution:**
P(X > 9) = (1-p)^9 where p = 1/4

P(X > 9) = (3/4)^9
         = 19683/262144
         ≈ 0.0751

**Answer: 19683/262144 ≈ 0.0751**

## Question 2 (4 marks)
**Topic:** Mean and Variance from Coded Data

A summary of 40 values of x gives: Σ(x-k) = 520, Σ(x-k)² = 9640, where k is a constant.

### Part (a) (2 marks)
Given that the mean of these 40 values of x is 34, find the value of k.

**Solution:**
Let y = x - k, so x = y + k

Mean of x = Mean of y + k
34 = (Σy)/40 + k
34 = 520/40 + k
34 = 13 + k
k = 34 - 13 = 21

**Answer: k = 21**

### Part (b) (2 marks)
Find the variance of these 40 values of x.

**Solution:**
Variance of x = Variance of y (since adding a constant doesn't change variance)

Variance of y = [Σy²]/n - [(Σy)/n]²
              = 9640/40 - (520/40)²
              = 241 - 13²
              = 241 - 169
              = 72

**Answer: Variance = 72**

## Question 3 (5 marks)
**Topic:** Conditional Probability

For her bedtime drink, Suki has either chocolate, tea or milk with probabilities 0.45, 0.35 and 0.2 respectively. When she has chocolate, the probability that she has a biscuit is 0.3. When she has tea, the probability that she has a biscuit is 0.6. When she has milk, she never has a biscuit.

Find the probability that Suki has tea given that she does not have a biscuit.

**Solution:**
Let C = chocolate, T = tea, M = milk, B = biscuit

Given:
- P(C) = 0.45, P(T) = 0.35, P(M) = 0.2
- P(B|C) = 0.3, P(B|T) = 0.6, P(B|M) = 0
- Therefore: P(B'|C) = 0.7, P(B'|T) = 0.4, P(B'|M) = 1

We need P(T|B')

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(T|B') = P(B'|T) × P(T) / P(B')

First, find P(B'):
P(B') = P(B'|C) × P(C) + P(B'|T) × P(T) + P(B'|M) × P(M)
      = 0.7 × 0.45 + 0.4 × 0.35 + 1 × 0.2
      = 0.315 + 0.14 + 0.2
      = 0.655

Therefore:
P(T|B') = (0.4 × 0.35) / 0.655
        = 0.14 / 0.655
        = 28/131

**Answer: 28/131 ≈ 0.214**

## Question 4 (6 marks)
**Topic:** Probability Distributions

A fair spinner has edges numbered 0, 1, 2, 2. Another fair spinner has edges numbered -1, 0, 1. Each spinner is spun. The random variable X is the sum of the numbers for the two spinners.

### Part (a) (3 marks)
Draw up the probability distribution table for X.

**Solution:**
Spinner 1: 0, 1, 2, 2 (each with probability 1/4)
Spinner 2: -1, 0, 1 (each with probability 1/3)

Possible sums:
- X = -1: (0,-1) → P = (1/4)(1/3) = 1/12
- X = 0: (0,0), (1,-1) → P = (1/4)(1/3) + (1/4)(1/3) = 2/12 = 1/6
- X = 1: (0,1), (1,0), (2,-1), (2,-1) → P = (1/4)(1/3) + (1/4)(1/3) + (1/4)(1/3) + (1/4)(1/3) = 4/12 = 1/3
- X = 2: (1,1), (2,0), (2,0) → P = (1/4)(1/3) + (1/4)(1/3) + (1/4)(1/3) = 3/12 = 1/4
- X = 3: (2,1), (2,1) → P = (1/4)(1/3) + (1/4)(1/3) = 2/12 = 1/6

**Probability Distribution Table:**
| X | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|----|----|----|----|----| 
| P(X) | 1/12 | 1/6 | 1/3 | 1/4 | 1/6 |

**Answer: Table shown above**

### Part (b) (3 marks)
Find Var(X).

**Solution:**
First find E(X):
E(X) = (-1)(1/12) + (0)(1/6) + (1)(1/3) + (2)(1/4) + (3)(1/6)
     = -1/12 + 0 + 1/3 + 1/2 + 1/2
     = -1/12 + 4/12 + 6/12 + 6/12
     = 15/12 = 5/4

Next find E(X²):
E(X²) = (1)(1/12) + (0)(1/6) + (1)(1/3) + (4)(1/4) + (9)(1/6)
      = 1/12 + 0 + 1/3 + 1 + 3/2
      = 1/12 + 4/12 + 12/12 + 18/12
      = 35/12

Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]²
       = 35/12 - (5/4)²
       = 35/12 - 25/16
       = 140/48 - 75/48
       = 65/48

**Answer: Var(X) = 65/48**

## Question 5 (10 marks)
**Topic:** Arrangements and Combinations

Raman and Sanjay are members of a quiz team which has 9 members in total. Two photographs of the quiz team are to be taken.

### Part (a) (1 mark)
For the first photograph, the 9 members will stand in a line. How many different arrangements of the 9 members are possible in which Raman will be at the centre of the line?

**Solution:**
With 9 people in a line, the centre position is the 5th position.
Fix Raman in the centre, arrange the remaining 8 people in the other 8 positions.

Number of arrangements = 8! = 40,320

**Answer: 40,320**

### Part (b) (3 marks)
How many different arrangements of the 9 members are possible in which Raman and Sanjay are not next to each other?

**Solution:**
Total arrangements = 9!
Arrangements where Raman and Sanjay are together:
- Treat them as one unit: 8 units to arrange = 8!
- Raman and Sanjay can be arranged within their unit in 2! ways
- Arrangements with them together = 8! × 2!

Arrangements where they are NOT together = 9! - 8! × 2!
= 362,880 - 40,320 × 2
= 362,880 - 80,640
= 282,240

**Answer: 282,240**

### Part (c) (2 marks)
For the second photograph, the members will stand in two rows, with 5 in the back row and 4 in the front row. In how many different ways can the 9 members be divided into a group of 5 and a group of 4?

**Solution:**
This is a combination problem - we need to choose 5 people for one group (the other 4 automatically form the second group).

Number of ways = C(9,5) = 9!/(5!×4!) = 126

**Answer: 126**

### Part (d) (4 marks)
For a random division into a group of 5 and a group of 4, find the probability that Raman and Sanjay are in the same group as each other.

**Solution:**
Total ways to divide 9 people into groups of 5 and 4 = C(9,5) = 126

Ways where Raman and Sanjay are in the same group:
- Both in group of 5: Choose 3 more from remaining 7 = C(7,3) = 35
- Both in group of 4: Choose 2 more from remaining 7 = C(7,2) = 21

Total favorable outcomes = 35 + 21 = 56

Probability = 56/126 = 4/9

**Answer: 4/9**

**Solution:**
```
Rebels | Stem | Sharks
       |  6   | 6 8
       |  7   | 1 2 4 5 5 6 8
9 8 5  |  8   | 3 3 4 5 6
       |  9   | 2
5 3 9  |  9   |
   2   | 10   |

Key: 5|8|3 means 85 kg (Rebels) and 83 kg (Sharks)
```

**Answer: Back-to-back stem-and-leaf diagram shown above**

### Part (b) (3 marks)
Find the median and the interquartile range for the Rebels.

**Solution:**
Rebels data (ordered): 75, 78, 79, 80, 82, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 89, 93, 95, 99, 102

n = 15, so median is the 8th value
Median = 84 kg

Q₁ position = (15+1)/4 = 4th value = 80 kg
Q₃ position = 3(15+1)/4 = 12th value = 93 kg

IQR = Q₃ - Q₁ = 93 - 80 = 13 kg

**Answer: Median = 84 kg, IQR = 13 kg**

### Part (c) (2 marks)
On the same diagram, draw a box-and-whisker plot for the Rebels.

**Solution:**
For Rebels:
- Minimum = 75 kg
- Q₁ = 80 kg  
- Median = 84 kg
- Q₃ = 93 kg
- Maximum = 102 kg

**Answer: Box plot drawn with the five-number summary above**

### Part (d) (1 mark)
Make one comparison between the weights of the players in the Rebels club and the weights of the players in the Sharks club.

**Solution:**
The Rebels players are generally heavier than the Sharks players (higher median/central tendency).

**Answer: The Rebels have higher average weights than the Sharks**

## Question 7 (11 marks)
**Topic:** Normal Distribution Applications

The times, in minutes, that Karli spends each day on social media are normally distributed with mean 125 and standard deviation 24.

### Part (a)(i) (5 marks)
On how many days of the year (365 days) would you expect Karli to spend more than 142 minutes on social media?

**Solution:**
Let X ~ N(125, 24²)

P(X > 142) = P(Z > (142-125)/24) = P(Z > 17/24) = P(Z > 0.708)

From normal tables: Φ(0.708) ≈ 0.7602
P(X > 142) = 1 - 0.7602 = 0.2398

Expected number of days = 365 × 0.2398 = 87.5

**Answer: 88 days**

### Part (a)(ii) (3 marks)
Find the probability that Karli spends more than 142 minutes on social media on fewer than 2 of 10 randomly chosen days.

**Solution:**
Let Y = number of days out of 10 where she spends more than 142 minutes
Y ~ B(10, 0.2398)

P(Y < 2) = P(Y = 0) + P(Y = 1)

P(Y = 0) = C(10,0) × (0.2398)⁰ × (0.7602)¹⁰ = (0.7602)¹⁰ = 0.0563
P(Y = 1) = C(10,1) × (0.2398)¹ × (0.7602)⁹ = 10 × 0.2398 × 0.0741 = 0.1777

P(Y < 2) = 0.0563 + 0.1777 = 0.234

**Answer: 0.234**

### Part (b) (3 marks)
On 90% of days, Karli spends more than t minutes on social media. Find the value of t.

**Solution:**
P(X > t) = 0.90
P(X ≤ t) = 0.10

From normal tables: Φ⁻¹(0.10) = -1.282

Standardizing: (t - 125)/24 = -1.282
t - 125 = 24 × (-1.282)
t = 125 - 30.77
t = 94.2

**Answer: t = 94.2 minutes**
