## Question 1 [3 marks total]
**Fair 5-sided spinner numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 spun repeatedly.**

### Part (a) [1 mark]
**Find P(score of 3 obtained for first time on 8th spin).**

### Solution:
This is a geometric distribution with p = 1/5 (probability of getting 3).

P(first 3 on 8th spin) = (4/5)^7 × (1/5) = (4/5)^7 × (1/5)

= 16384/390625 = 0.0419

**Answer: 16384/390625 = 0.0419**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: (4/5)^7 × (1/5) = 16384/390625 or 0.0419

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**Find P(fewer than 6 spins required to obtain score of 3 for first time).**

### Solution:
P(fewer than 6 spins) = P(X < 6) = 1 - P(X ≥ 6) = 1 - (4/5)^5

= 1 - 1024/3125 = 2101/3125 = 0.672

**Answer: 2101/3125 = 0.672**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: 1 - (4/5)^5 or sum of geometric terms
✓ A1: 2101/3125 or 0.672

## Question 2 [5 marks total]
**Georgie's scarf colors: Red (0.2), Blue (0.45), Yellow (0.35). Hat probabilities: Red→1.0, Blue→0.4, Yellow→0.3.**

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Find P(wears hat on randomly chosen day).**

### Solution:
Using law of total probability:
P(Hat) = P(Red) × P(Hat|Red) + P(Blue) × P(Hat|Blue) + P(Yellow) × P(Hat|Yellow)
P(Hat) = 0.2 × 1 + 0.45 × 0.4 + 0.35 × 0.3
P(Hat) = 0.2 + 0.18 + 0.105 = 0.485

**Answer: 0.485 or 97/200**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: 0.2 × 1 + 0.45 × 0.4 + 0.35 × 0.3
✓ A1: 0.485 or 97/200

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Find P(yellow scarf | no hat).**

### Solution:
Using Bayes' theorem:
P(Yellow|No Hat) = P(Yellow ∩ No Hat) / P(No Hat)

P(Yellow ∩ No Hat) = 0.35 × 0.7 = 0.245
P(No Hat) = 1 - P(Hat) = 1 - 0.485 = 0.515

P(Yellow|No Hat) = 0.245/0.515 = 49/103 = 0.476

**Answer: 49/103 = 0.476**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: 0.35 × 0.7 = 0.245 seen as numerator or denominator
✓ M1: 0.515 or 1 - 0.485 seen as denominator
✓ A1: 49/103 or 0.476

## Question 3 [6 marks total]
**Shopping time ~ N(96, 18²) minutes.**

### Part (a) [3 marks]
**Find P(shopper spends between 85 and 100 minutes).**

### Solution:
Let X ~ N(96, 18²)

Standardizing:
P(85 < X < 100) = P((85-96)/18 < Z < (100-96)/18)
= P(-0.611 < Z < 0.222)
= Φ(0.222) - Φ(-0.611)
= Φ(0.222) - (1 - Φ(0.611))
= 0.5879 + 0.7294 - 1 = 0.317

**Answer: 0.317**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: Use of standardisation formula with appropriate values
✓ M1: Appropriate area Φ from final process
✓ A1: 0.317

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**88% spend more than t minutes. Find t.**

### Solution:
P(X > t) = 0.88
P(X ≤ t) = 0.12

Standardizing: P(Z ≤ (t-96)/18) = 0.12

From normal tables: Φ(-1.175) = 0.12
So: (t-96)/18 = -1.175
t - 96 = -1.175 × 18 = -21.15
t = 96 - 21.15 = 74.85

**Answer: t = 74.9**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: z = ±1.175
✓ M1: (t-96)/18 = -1.175
✓ A1: 74.85 or 74.9

## Question 4 [6 marks total]
**Random variable X takes values 1, 2, 3, 4 with P(X = x) = kx(5-x).**

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Draw probability distribution table in terms of k.**

### Solution:
For x = 1: P(X = 1) = k × 1 × (5-1) = 4k
For x = 2: P(X = 2) = k × 2 × (5-2) = 6k
For x = 3: P(X = 3) = k × 3 × (5-3) = 6k
For x = 4: P(X = 4) = k × 4 × (5-4) = 4k

| x | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P(X = x) | 4k | 6k | 6k | 4k |

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: Table with x values and one correct probability in terms of k
✓ B1: Remaining 3 probabilities correct in terms of k

### Part (b) [4 marks]
**Show that Var(X) = 1.05.**

### Solution:
Since probabilities sum to 1:
4k + 6k + 6k + 4k = 1
20k = 1
k = 1/20 = 0.05

So probabilities are: 4/20, 6/20, 6/20, 4/20

E(X) = 1×(4/20) + 2×(6/20) + 3×(6/20) + 4×(4/20)
     = 4/20 + 12/20 + 18/20 + 16/20 = 50/20 = 2.5

E(X²) = 1²×(4/20) + 2²×(6/20) + 3²×(6/20) + 4²×(4/20)
      = 4/20 + 24/20 + 54/20 + 64/20 = 146/20 = 7.3

Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]² = 7.3 - (2.5)² = 7.3 - 6.25 = 1.05

**Answer: Var(X) = 1.05 ✓**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: k = 0.05 or 1/20
✓ M1: Correct expression for E(X) with numerical probabilities
✓ M1: Appropriate variance formula with correct substitution
✓ A1: 1.05 (Answer Given)

## Question 5 [9 marks total]
**Distance data for 150 journeys.**

### Part (a) [4 marks]
**Draw cumulative frequency graph.**

### Solution:
First, calculate cumulative frequencies:

| Distance (km) | Frequency | Upper Boundary | Cumulative Frequency |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|---------------------|
| 0-4 | 12 | 4.5 | 12 |
| 5-10 | 16 | 10.5 | 28 |
| 11-20 | 32 | 20.5 | 60 |
| 21-30 | 66 | 30.5 | 126 |
| 31-40 | 20 | 40.5 | 146 |
| 41-60 | 4 | 60.5 | 150 |

Plot points: (4.5, 12), (10.5, 28), (20.5, 60), (30.5, 126), (40.5, 146), (60.5, 150)
Join with smooth curve starting from (0, 0).

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: Correct cumulative frequencies (12, 28, 60, 126, 146, 150)

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**30% of journeys are d km or more. Estimate d.**

### Solution:
30% of 150 = 45 journeys are d km or more
So 70% of 150 = 105 journeys are less than d km

From the cumulative frequency graph, when cf = 105, d ≈ 27 km

**Answer: d ≈ 27 km**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: 105 seen or implied by use on graph
✓ A1: Approximately 27 (FT their graph)

### Part (c) [3 marks]
**Calculate estimate of mean distance.**

### Solution:
Using midpoints:

| Distance | Midpoint | Frequency | fx |
|----------|----------|-----------|-----|
| 0-4 | 2.25 | 12 | 27 |
| 5-10 | 7.5 | 16 | 120 |
| 11-20 | 15.5 | 32 | 496 |
| 21-30 | 25.5 | 66 | 1683 |
| 31-40 | 35.5 | 20 | 710 |
| 41-60 | 50.5 | 4 | 202 |

Mean = Σfx/Σf = (27 + 120 + 496 + 1683 + 710 + 202)/150
     = 3238/150 = 21.6 km

**Answer: 21.6 km**

### Mark Scheme Validation:

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Find total arrangements of CATERPILLAR.**

### Solution:
Total arrangements = 11!/(2! × 2! × 2!) = 39916800/8 = 4,989,600

**Answer: 4,989,600**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: 11! alone as numerator, 2! × m! × n! on denominator
✓ A1: 4,989,600 (exact answer)

### Part (b) [4 marks]
**Find arrangements with R at beginning and end, As not together.**

### Solution:
Fix R at positions 1 and 11: R _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ R

Remaining 9 letters: C, A, A, T, E, P, I, L, L

Step 1: Arrange 7 letters (excluding As): C, T, E, P, I, L, L
Number of ways = 7!/2! = 2520

Step 2: Choose 2 positions from 8 available positions for the As
Number of ways = ⁸C₂ = 28

## Question 7 [11 marks total]
**400 students surveyed about sport preferences.**

| | Swimming | Cycling | Running | Total |
|---|----------|---------|---------|-------|
| Female | 104 | 50 | 66 | 220 |
| Male | 31 | 57 | 92 | 180 |
| Total | 135 | 107 | 158 | 400 |

### Part (a)(i) [1 mark]
**Find P(student prefers swimming).**

### Solution:
P(Swimming) = 135/400 = 27/80 = 0.3375

**Answer: 27/80 = 0.3375**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: 135/400 = 27/80 = 0.3375

### Part (a)(ii) [2 marks]
**Test independence of 'male' and 'prefers swimming'.**

### Solution:
P(Male) = 180/400 = 0.45
P(Swimming) = 135/400 = 0.3375
P(Male ∩ Swimming) = 31/400 = 0.0775

If independent: P(Male) × P(Swimming) = 0.45 × 0.3375 = 0.151875

Since P(Male ∩ Swimming) = 0.0775 ≠ 0.151875, the events are NOT independent.

**Answer: NOT independent**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: P(Male) × P(Swimming) seen
✓ A1: Correct comparison and conclusion with proper notation

### Part (b)(i) [3 marks]
**10 students chosen randomly. Find P(at least 3 don't like sports). [30% don't like sports]**

### Solution:
Let X = number who don't like sports, X ~ B(10, 0.3)

P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X ≤ 2) = 1 - [P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2)]

P(X=0) = ¹⁰C₀ × (0.3)⁰ × (0.7)¹⁰ = 0.028248
P(X=1) = ¹⁰C₁ × (0.3)¹ × (0.7)⁹ = 0.121061
P(X=2) = ¹⁰C₂ × (0.3)² × (0.7)⁸ = 0.233474

P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - (0.028248 + 0.121061 + 0.233474) = 1 - 0.382783 = 0.617

**Answer: 0.617**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: ¹⁰Cₓ × pˣ × (1-p)¹⁰⁻ˣ for 0 < x < 10, 0 < p < 1
✓ A1: Correct expression
✓ A1: 0.617

### Part (b)(ii) [5 marks]
**90 students chosen. Use approximation for P(fewer than 32 don't like sports).**

### Solution:
Let Y = number who don't like sports, Y ~ B(90, 0.3)

Using normal approximation:
μ = np = 90 × 0.3 = 27
σ² = np(1-p) = 90 × 0.3 × 0.7 = 18.9
σ = √18.9 = 4.347

With continuity correction:
P(Y < 32) = P(Y ≤ 31.5)

Standardizing: Z = (31.5 - 27)/√18.9 = 4.5/4.347 = 1.035

P(Y < 32) = P(Z < 1.035) = Φ(1.035) = 0.850

**Answer: 0.850**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: Correct mean = 27 and variance = 18.9
✓ M1: Substituting μ and σ into standardising formula with 31.5
✓ M1: Using continuity correction 31.5
✓ M1: Appropriate area Φ from final process
✓ A1: 0.850
