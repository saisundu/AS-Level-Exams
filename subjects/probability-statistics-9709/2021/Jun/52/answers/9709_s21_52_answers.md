## Question 1 [5 marks total]
**Fair die thrown repeatedly until a 5 is obtained. X = number of throws.**

### Part (a) [1 mark]
**Write down the mean of X**

### Solution:
This follows a geometric distribution with p = 1/6 (probability of getting a 5).

For geometric distribution, mean = 1/p = 1/(1/6) = 6

**Answer: 6**

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**Find P(5 is first obtained after 3rd throw but before 8th throw)**

### Solution:
"After 3rd throw but before 8th throw" means on the 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th throw.

For geometric distribution: P(X = k) = (1-p)^(k-1) × p where p = 1/6

P(X = 4) = (5/6)³ × (1/6)
P(X = 5) = (5/6)⁴ × (1/6)
P(X = 6) = (5/6)⁵ × (1/6)
P(X = 7) = (5/6)⁶ × (1/6)

P(4 ≤ X ≤ 7) = (1/6)[(5/6)³ + (5/6)⁴ + (5/6)⁵ + (5/6)⁶]
                = (1/6) × (5/6)³ × [1 + (5/6) + (5/6)² + (5/6)³]
                = (1/6) × (125/216) × [1 + 5/6 + 25/36 + 125/216]
                = (1/6) × (125/216) × (1296/216)
                = 0.300

**Answer: 0.300**

### Part (c) [2 marks]
**Find P(5 is first obtained in fewer than 10 throws)**

### Solution:
P(X < 10) = P(X ≤ 9) = 1 - P(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X > 9)

For geometric distribution: P(X > k) = (1-p)^k

P(X > 9) = (5/6)⁹ = 0.194

P(X < 10) = 1 - 0.194 = 0.806

**Answer: 0.806**

## Question 2 [4 marks total]
**Sugar bags: N(1.04, σ²). Sample of 2000 bags, 72 weighed more than 1.10 kg.**

### Solution:
Let X = weight of sugar bag, X ~ N(1.04, σ²)

**Step 1: Find sample proportion**
P(X > 1.10) = 72/2000 = 0.036

**Step 2: Standardize**
P(X > 1.10) = P(Z > (1.10-1.04)/σ) = P(Z > 0.06/σ) = 0.036

**Step 3: Find critical z-value**
P(Z > z) = 0.036
P(Z ≤ z) = 1 - 0.036 = 0.964

From normal tables: z = 1.798

**Step 4: Solve for σ**
0.06/σ = 1.798
σ = 0.06/1.798 = 0.0334

**Answer: σ = 0.0334**

## Question 3 [6 marks total]
**Alexa's travel: Bus (0.4, late 0.55), Train (0.35, late 0.7), Car (0.25, late x). P(not late) = 0.48**

### Part (a) [3 marks]
**Find the value of x**

### Solution:
Using the law of total probability:

P(not late) = P(Bus) × P(not late|Bus) + P(Train) × P(not late|Train) + P(Car) × P(not late|Car)

0.48 = 0.4 × (1-0.55) + 0.35 × (1-0.7) + 0.25 × (1-x)
0.48 = 0.4 × 0.45 + 0.35 × 0.3 + 0.25 × (1-x)
0.48 = 0.18 + 0.105 + 0.25(1-x)
0.48 = 0.285 + 0.25 - 0.25x
0.48 = 0.535 - 0.25x
0.25x = 0.535 - 0.48 = 0.055
x = 0.055/0.25 = 0.22

**Answer: x = 0.22**

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Find P(travels by train | arrives late)**

### Solution:
Using Bayes' theorem: P(Train|Late) = P(Train ∩ Late)/P(Late)

**Step 1: Find P(Train ∩ Late)**
P(Train ∩ Late) = P(Train) × P(Late|Train) = 0.35 × 0.7 = 0.245

**Step 2: Find P(Late)**
P(Late) = 1 - P(not late) = 1 - 0.48 = 0.52

**Step 3: Calculate conditional probability**
P(Train|Late) = 0.245/0.52 = 49/104 = 0.471

**Answer: 0.471 or 49/104**

## Question 4 [6 marks total]
**Two spinners: Spinner 1 (1,2,2), Spinner 2 (-2,0,1). X = sum of numbers.**

### Part (a) [3 marks]
**Draw up probability distribution table for X**

### Solution:
**Step 1: List all possible outcomes**
Spinner 1 outcomes: 1 (prob 1/3), 2 (prob 2/3)
Spinner 2 outcomes: -2 (prob 1/3), 0 (prob 1/3), 1 (prob 1/3)

**Step 2: Calculate all possible sums**
- (1,-2): X = -1, P = (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9
- (1,0): X = 1, P = (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9
- (1,1): X = 2, P = (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9
- (2,-2): X = 0, P = (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9
- (2,0): X = 2, P = (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9
- (2,1): X = 3, P = (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9

**Step 3: Combine probabilities for same X values**

| X | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|----|----|----|----|----| 
| P(X) | 1/9 | 2/9 | 1/9 | 3/9 | 2/9 |

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Find E(X) and Var(X)**

### Solution:
**Step 1: Calculate E(X)**
E(X) = (-1)(1/9) + (0)(2/9) + (1)(1/9) + (2)(3/9) + (3)(2/9)
     = -1/9 + 0 + 1/9 + 6/9 + 6/9
     = 12/9 = 4/3

**Step 2: Calculate E(X²)**
E(X²) = (-1)²(1/9) + (0)²(2/9) + (1)²(1/9) + (2)²(3/9) + (3)²(2/9)
      = 1/9 + 0 + 1/9 + 12/9 + 18/9
      = 32/9

**Step 3: Calculate Var(X)**
Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]²
       = 32/9 - (4/3)²
       = 32/9 - 16/9
       = 16/9

**Answer: E(X) = 4/3, Var(X) = 16/9**

## Question 5 [9 marks total]
**Richard's flights: Early (0.15), On time (0.55), Late (0.3)**

### Part (a) [1 mark]
**P(flight does not arrive late on each of 3 days)**

### Solution:
P(not late) = P(early) + P(on time) = 0.15 + 0.55 = 0.7

P(not late on all 3 days) = (0.7)³ = 0.343

**Answer: 0.343**

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**P(flight arrives early at least 3 times in 9 days)**

### Solution:
Let Y = number of early arrivals in 9 days, Y ~ B(9, 0.15)

P(Y ≥ 3) = 1 - P(Y ≤ 2) = 1 - [P(Y=0) + P(Y=1) + P(Y=2)]

P(Y=0) = ⁹C₀(0.15)⁰(0.85)⁹ = (0.85)⁹ = 0.2316
P(Y=1) = ⁹C₁(0.15)¹(0.85)⁸ = 9 × 0.15 × (0.85)⁸ = 0.3679
P(Y=2) = ⁹C₂(0.15)²(0.85)⁷ = 36 × (0.15)² × (0.85)⁷ = 0.2597

P(Y ≥ 3) = 1 - (0.2316 + 0.3679 + 0.2597) = 1 - 0.8592 = 0.141

**Answer: 0.141**

### Part (c) [5 marks]
**60 days: P(early at least 12 times) using approximation**

### Solution:
Let Z = number of early arrivals in 60 days, Z ~ B(60, 0.15)

**Step 1: Check conditions for normal approximation**
n = 60, p = 0.15
np = 60 × 0.15 = 9 > 5 ✓
n(1-p) = 60 × 0.85 = 51 > 5 ✓

**Step 2: Find parameters**
Mean μ = np = 9
Variance σ² = np(1-p) = 60 × 0.15 × 0.85 = 7.65
Standard deviation σ = √7.65 = 2.766

**Step 3: Apply continuity correction**
P(Z ≥ 12) = P(Z > 11.5) using continuity correction

**Step 4: Standardize**
P(Z > 11.5) = P(W > (11.5-9)/2.766) = P(W > 0.904)

where W ~ N(0,1)

**Step 5: Calculate probability**
P(W > 0.904) = 1 - Φ(0.904) = 1 - 0.817 = 0.183

**Answer: 0.183**

## Question 6 [10 marks total]
**Word TOMORROW (T-O-M-O-R-R-O-W): 1T, 3O, 1M, 2R, 1W**

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Total arrangements of 8 letters**

### Solution:
Total letters = 8
Repeated letters: O appears 3 times, R appears 2 times

Number of arrangements = 8!/(3! × 2!) = 40320/(6 × 2) = 40320/12 = 3360

**Answer: 3360**

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Arrangements with R at beginning and end, three Os not all together**

### Solution:
**Step 1: Fix Rs at ends**
With R at beginning and R at end, we arrange the middle 6 letters: T, O, M, O, O, W

**Step 2: Total arrangements with Rs at ends**
Middle 6 letters with 3 Os: 6!/3! = 720/6 = 120

**Step 3: Arrangements with 3 Os together**
Treat OOO as one unit with T, M, W: 4 units to arrange = 4! = 24

**Step 4: Arrangements with Os not all together**
Required arrangements = 120 - 24 = 96

**Answer: 96**

### Part (c) [5 marks]

**Scenario 3: 2O, 1R, 1 other**
- Choose 2O from 3: ³C₂ = 3
- Choose 1R from 2: ²C₁ = 2
- Choose 1 from {T,M,W}: ³C₁ = 3
- Total: 3 × 2 × 3 = 18

**Scenario 4: 2O, 2R**
- Choose 2O from 3: ³C₂ = 3
- Choose 2R from 2: ²C₂ = 1
- Total: 3 × 1 = 3

**Scenario 5: 3O, 1R**
- Choose 3O from 3: ³C₃ = 1
- Choose 1R from 2: ²C₁ = 2
- Total: 1 × 2 = 2

**Step 2: Sum all favorable outcomes**
Total favorable = 18 + 9 + 18 + 3 + 2 = 50

**Step 3: Calculate probability**
P(at least one O and at least one R) = 50/70 = 5/7 = 0.714

**Answer: 5/7 or 0.714**

### Part (a) [1 mark]
**Advantage of stem-and-leaf over box-and-whisker plot**

### Solution:
A stem-and-leaf diagram shows all the raw data values, allowing for further statistical calculations (like mean, mode, standard deviation) that cannot be determined from a box-and-whisker plot alone.

**Answer: Shows all raw data values / allows further statistical analysis**

### Part (b) [4 marks]
**Back-to-back stem-and-leaf diagram**

### Solution:
```
Amazons          |  Giants
                 |
        8 1      | 17 | 5
    6 2 1 0      | 18 | 2 4 7 9
        8 4      | 19 | 2 3 5 5 5
    5 2 1        | 20 | 4
                 | 21 |
        5        | 21 |

Key: 1|18|2 means 181 cm for Amazons and 182 cm for Giants
```

### Part (c) [2 marks]
**Interquartile range of Amazons' heights**

### Solution:
**Step 1: Order Amazons' data**
178, 181, 182, 184, 190, 196, 198, 201, 202, 205, 215

**Step 2: Find quartiles**
n = 11
Q₁ position = (11+1)/4 = 3rd value = 182
Q₃ position = 3(11+1)/4 = 9th value = 202

**Step 3: Calculate IQR**
IQR = Q₃ - Q₁ = 202 - 182 = 20

**Answer: 20 cm**

### Part (d) [3 marks]
**Height of fourth new player**

### Solution:
**Step 1: Calculate sum of original 11 heights**
Sum₁₁ = 178 + 181 + 182 + 184 + 190 + 196 + 198 + 201 + 202 + 205 + 215 = 2132

**Step 2: Calculate sum of 15 heights**
Mean₁₅ = 191.2 cm
Sum₁₅ = 15 × 191.2 = 2868

**Step 3: Find fourth player's height**
Sum₁₅ = Sum₁₁ + (180 + 185 + 190) + h
2868 = 2132 + 555 + h
2868 = 2687 + h
h = 2868 - 2687 = 181

**Answer: 181 cm**
