## Question 1 [5 marks total]
**Cumulative frequency curve for heights of 160 sunflower plants**

### Part (a) [1 mark]
**Estimate number of plants with heights less than 100 cm**

### Solution:
Reading from the cumulative frequency curve at height = 100 cm:
Cumulative frequency ≈ 60

**Answer: 60**

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**Estimate the 65th percentile**

### Solution:
**Step 1: Find position of 65th percentile**
65% of 160 = 0.65 × 160 = 104

**Step 2: Read from graph**
Find the height corresponding to cumulative frequency = 104
From the graph: Height ≈ 136 cm

**Answer: 136 cm**

### Part (c) [2 marks]
**Estimate the interquartile range**

### Solution:
**Step 1: Find quartile positions**
- Q₁ position: 25% of 160 = 40
- Q₃ position: 75% of 160 = 120

**Step 2: Read from graph**
- Q₁ (cumulative frequency = 40): Height ≈ 76 cm
- Q₃ (cumulative frequency = 120): Height ≈ 150 cm

**Step 3: Calculate IQR**
IQR = Q₃ - Q₁ = 150 - 76 = 74 cm

**Answer: 74 cm**

## Question 2 [4 marks total]
**Probability distribution: X can take values -2, -1, 0, 1, 2**

| x | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 |
|---|----|----|---|---|---|
| P(X=x) | p | p | 0.1 | q | q |

**Given: P(X ≥ 0) = 3P(X < 0)**

### Solution:
**Step 1: Set up probability sum equation**
Sum of all probabilities = 1
p + p + 0.1 + q + q = 1
2p + 2q + 0.1 = 1
2p + 2q = 0.9 ... (1)

**Step 2: Use given condition**
P(X ≥ 0) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) = 0.1 + q + q = 0.1 + 2q
P(X < 0) = P(X = -2) + P(X = -1) = p + p = 2p

Given: P(X ≥ 0) = 3P(X < 0)
0.1 + 2q = 3(2p)
0.1 + 2q = 6p ... (2)

**Step 3: Solve simultaneous equations**
From equation (1): 2p + 2q = 0.9
From equation (2): 6p - 2q = 0.1

Adding equations: 8p = 1.0
p = 1/8 = 0.125

Substituting back: 2(0.125) + 2q = 0.9
0.25 + 2q = 0.9
2q = 0.65
q = 0.325 = 13/40

**Answer: p = 1/8 = 0.125, q = 13/40 = 0.325**

## Question 3 [5 marks total]
**Sports club with volleyball and hockey teams**

**Volleyball team (6 members):** Σx = 1050, Σx² = 193,700
**Hockey team (11 members):** Σy = 1991, Σy² = 366,400

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Find mean height of all 17 members**

### Solution:
Mean height = (Σx + Σy)/(6 + 11) = (1050 + 1991)/17 = 3041/17 = 178.9 cm

**Answer: 178.9 cm**

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Find standard deviation of heights of all 17 members**

### Solution:
**Step 1: Calculate combined sum of squares**
Σ(combined)² = Σx² + Σy² = 193,700 + 366,400 = 560,100

**Step 2: Apply variance formula**
Variance = [Σ(combined)²]/n - (mean)²
         = 560,100/17 - (178.9)²
         = 32,947.06 - 32,005.21
         = 941.85

**Step 3: Calculate standard deviation**
Standard deviation = √941.85 = 30.7 cm

**Answer: 30.7 cm**

## Question 4 [6 marks total]
**Three fair six-sided dice thrown repeatedly**

### Part (a) [3 marks]
**Find P(score = 4) on single throw**

### Solution:
**Step 1: Find all ways to get sum = 4**
Possible combinations: (1,1,2), (1,2,1), (2,1,1)
Total: 3 ways

**Step 2: Calculate probability**
Total possible outcomes = 6³ = 216
P(score = 4) = 3/216 = 1/72

**Answer: 1/72**

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Find P(score = 18 first obtained on 5th throw)**

### Solution:
**Step 1: Find P(score = 18)**
Only one way to get sum = 18: (6,6,6)
P(score = 18) = 1/216

**Step 2: Apply geometric distribution**
P(first success on 5th throw) = (1-p)⁴ × p
where p = 1/216

P(score = 18 on 5th throw) = (215/216)⁴ × (1/216)
                            = (215⁴/216⁴) × (1/216)
                            = 215⁴/216⁵
                            = 0.00454

**Answer: 0.00454**

## Question 5 [9 marks total]
**Leaf lengths modeled by normal distribution**

### Part (a) [5 marks]
**Find estimates for mean and standard deviation**

**Given:** Sample of 500 leaves, 42 < 4 cm, 100 > 10 cm

### Solution:
**Step 1: Set up probability equations**
P(X < 4) = 42/500 = 0.084
P(X > 10) = 100/500 = 0.20

**Step 2: Find z-values**
For P(Z < z₁) = 0.084: z₁ = -1.378
For P(Z > z₂) = 0.20: z₂ = 0.842

**Step 3: Set up standardization equations**
(4 - μ)/σ = -1.378 ... (1)
(10 - μ)/σ = 0.842 ... (2)

**Step 4: Solve simultaneous equations**
From (1): 4 - μ = -1.378σ
From (2): 10 - μ = 0.842σ

Subtracting: 6 = 2.22σ
σ = 6/2.22 = 2.70

Substituting back: μ = 4 + 1.378 × 2.70 = 7.72

**Answer: μ = 7.72 cm, σ = 2.70 cm**

### Part (b) [4 marks]
**Different tree: N(μ, 3²). Sample of 800 leaves. Expected number between μ-6 and μ+6**

### Solution:
**Step 1: Standardize the interval**
P(μ-6 < X < μ+6) = P(-6/3 < Z < 6/3) = P(-2 < Z < 2)

**Step 2: Calculate probability**
P(-2 < Z < 2) = Φ(2) - Φ(-2) = Φ(2) - [1 - Φ(2)] = 2Φ(2) - 1
                = 2(0.9772) - 1 = 0.9544

**Step 3: Find expected number**
Expected number = 800 × 0.9544 = 763.52 ≈ 764

**Answer: 764 leaves**

## Question 6 [10 marks total]
**Word REQUIREMENT: R-E-Q-U-I-R-E-M-E-N-T (11 letters)**
**Letter frequencies: R(2), E(3), Q(1), U(1), I(1), M(1), N(1), T(1)**

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Total arrangements of 11 letters**

### Solution:
Total arrangements = 11!/(2! × 3!) = 39,916,800/(2 × 6) = 3,326,400

**Answer: 3,326,400**

### Part (b) [1 mark]
**Arrangements with 2 Rs together and 3 Es together**

### Solution:
Treat RR as one unit and EEE as one unit.
Units to arrange: {RR}, {EEE}, Q, U, I, M, N, T = 8 units
Arrangements = 8! = 40,320

**Answer: 40,320**

### Part (c) [3 marks]
**Arrangements with exactly 3 letters between the 2 Rs**

### Solution:
**Step 1: Position the Rs**
If Rs are in positions i and i+4, there are exactly 3 letters between them.
Number of ways to place Rs: 7 (positions 1&5, 2&6, 3&7, 4&8, 5&9, 6&10, 7&11)

**Step 2: Arrange remaining letters**
Remaining 9 positions for 9 letters (3 Es identical): 9!/3!

**Step 3: Calculate total**
Total arrangements = 7 × (9!/3!) = 7 × 60,480 = 423,360

**Answer: 423,360**

### Part (d) [4 marks]
**5 letters selected: at least 2 Es and at least 1 R**

### Solution:
**Available letters:** R(2), E(3), others(6)

**Scenario 1: 2E, 1R, 2 others**
Ways = ³C₂ × ²C₁ × ⁶C₂ = 3 × 2 × 15 = 90
But this gives 5 letters total, so: ³C₂ × ²C₁ × ⁶C₂ = 15

**Scenario 2: 2E, 2R, 1 other**
Ways = ³C₂ × ²C₂ × ⁶C₁ = 3 × 1 × 6 = 6

**Scenario 3: 3E, 1R, 1 other**
Ways = ³C₃ × ²C₁ × ⁶C₁ = 1 × 2 × 6 = 6

**Scenario 4: 3E, 2R, 0 others**
Ways = ³C₃ × ²C₂ × ⁶C₀ = 1 × 1 × 1 = 1

**Total = 15 + 6 + 6 + 1 = 28**

**Answer: 28**

## Question 7 [13 marks total]
**Broadband service quality in three villages**

| Village | Excellent | Good | Poor | Total |
|---------|-----------|------|------|-------|
| Reeta   | 75        | 118  | 32   | 225   |
| Shan    | 223       | 177  | 40   | 440   |
| Teber   | 126       | 60   | 63   | 249   |
| **Total** | **424**   | **355** | **135** | **800** |

### Part (a)(i) [1 mark]
**P(household in Shan and has poor service)**

### Solution:
P(Shan ∩ Poor) = 40/800 = 1/20 = 0.05

**Answer: 1/20 or 0.05**

### Part (a)(ii) [2 marks]
**P(good service | household in Shan)**

### Solution:
P(Good | Shan) = P(Good ∩ Shan)/P(Shan) = (177/800)/(440/800) = 177/440

**Answer: 177/440 or 0.402**

### Part (b)(i) [3 marks]
**10 households chosen: P(fewer than 3 have no broadband)**

**Given:** 35% have no broadband service

### Solution:
Let X = number with no broadband, X ~ B(10, 0.35)

P(X < 3) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)

P(X = 0) = ¹⁰C₀(0.35)⁰(0.65)¹⁰ = 0.01346
P(X = 1) = ¹⁰C₁(0.35)¹(0.65)⁹ = 0.07249
P(X = 2) = ¹⁰C₂(0.35)²(0.65)⁸ = 0.17565

P(X < 3) = 0.01346 + 0.07249 + 0.17565 = 0.262

**Answer: 0.262**

### Part (b)(ii) [5 marks]
**120 households: P(more than 32 have no broadband) using approximation**

### Solution:
Let Y = number with no broadband, Y ~ B(120, 0.35)

**Step 1: Check conditions for normal approximation**
np = 120 × 0.35 = 42 > 5 ✓
n(1-p) = 120 × 0.65 = 78 > 5 ✓

**Step 2: Find parameters**
Mean μ = np = 42
Variance σ² = np(1-p) = 120 × 0.35 × 0.65 = 27.3
Standard deviation σ = √27.3 = 5.225

**Step 3: Apply continuity correction**
P(Y > 32) = P(Y ≥ 33) ≈ P(Z ≥ 32.5) using continuity correction

**Step 4: Standardize**
P(Z ≥ (32.5-42)/5.225) = P(Z ≥ -1.818) = Φ(1.818) = 0.966

**Answer: 0.966**
