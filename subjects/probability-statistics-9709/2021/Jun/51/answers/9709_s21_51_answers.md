## Question 1 [4 marks total]
**Bag contains 12 marbles: 8 red, 4 blue. Find selections of 5 marbles with at least 4 of same colour.**

### Solution:
Need to find selections with exactly 4 or exactly 5 marbles of the same colour.

**Case 1: Exactly 4 red, 1 blue (RRRRB)**
- Choose 4 red from 8: ⁸C₄ = 70
- Choose 1 blue from 4: ⁴C₁ = 4
- Total: ⁸C₄ × ⁴C₁ = 70 × 4 = 280

**Case 2: Exactly 4 blue, 1 red (BBBBR)**
- Choose 4 blue from 4: ⁴C₄ = 1
- Choose 1 red from 8: ⁸C₁ = 8
- Total: ⁴C₄ × ⁸C₁ = 1 × 8 = 8

**Case 3: Exactly 5 red, 0 blue (RRRRR)**
- Choose 5 red from 8: ⁸C₅ = 56
- Choose 0 blue from 4: ⁴C₀ = 1
- Total: ⁸C₅ × ⁴C₀ = 56 × 1 = 56

**Note:** Cannot have 5 blue marbles since only 4 blue marbles exist.

**Total selections = 280 + 8 + 56 = 344**

**Answer: 344**

## Question 2 [5 marks total]
**Metal rods: N(25.2, 0.4²). Sample of 500 rods. Expected number within 0.5 cm of mean.**

### Solution:
Let X = length of rod, X ~ N(25.2, 0.4²)

Need P(25.2 - 0.5 ≤ X ≤ 25.2 + 0.5) = P(24.7 ≤ X ≤ 25.7)

**Step 1: Standardize using Z = (X - μ)/σ**
P(24.7 ≤ X ≤ 25.7) = P((24.7-25.2)/0.4 ≤ Z ≤ (25.7-25.2)/0.4)
                     = P(-0.5/0.4 ≤ Z ≤ 0.5/0.4)
                     = P(-1.25 ≤ Z ≤ 1.25)

**Step 2: Calculate probability using normal tables**
P(-1.25 ≤ Z ≤ 1.25) = Φ(1.25) - Φ(-1.25)
                      = Φ(1.25) - (1 - Φ(1.25))
                      = 2Φ(1.25) - 1
                      = 2(0.8944) - 1
                      = 1.7888 - 1 = 0.7888

**Step 3: Calculate expected number**
Expected number = 0.7888 × 500 = 394.4

**Answer: 394 rods** (or 395 rods)

## Question 3 [8 marks total]
**Arrangements of letters in RELEASED**

### Part (a) [1 mark]
**Total arrangements of 8 letters in RELEASED**

### Solution:
Letters: R-E-L-E-A-S-E-D
- Total letters: 8
- Repeated letter E appears 3 times
- All other letters appear once

Number of arrangements = 8!/3! = 40320/6 = 6720

**Answer: 6720**

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Arrangements where LED appear together in that order**

### Solution:
**Step 1: Treat LED as a single unit**
When LED is treated as one unit, we have:
- The LED unit (1 item)
- Remaining letters: R, E, A, S, E (5 items)
- Total items to arrange: 6

**Step 2: Account for repeated letters**
Among the remaining letters R, E, A, S, E:
- E appears 2 times
- All others appear once

**Step 3: Calculate arrangements**
Number of arrangements = 6!/2! = 720/2 = 360

**Answer: 360**

### Part (c) [4 marks]
**Probability that A and D are not together**

### Solution:
**Method: Total arrangements - Arrangements with A and D together**

**Step 1: Total arrangements (from part a)**
Total = 6720

**Step 2: Arrangements with A and D together**
Treat AD as a single unit:
- The AD unit (1 item)
- Remaining letters: R, E, L, E, S, E (6 items)
- Total items to arrange: 7

Among remaining letters, E appears 3 times.
Arrangements with AD together = 7!/3! × 2 = 5040/6 × 2 = 1680
(×2 because AD can be arranged as AD or DA)

**Step 3: Arrangements with A and D not together**
Arrangements with A and D not together = 6720 - 1680 = 5040

**Step 4: Calculate probability**
P(A and D not together) = 5040/6720 = 3/4 = 0.75

**Answer: 3/4 or 0.75**

                         P(Pass) = 0.3   P(Fail) = 0.7
                             |               |
                        Get Place       No Place
```

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**Probability of gaining a place**

### Solution:
**Path 1: Pass first written, pass practical**
P(W₁P ∩ PP) = 0.8 × 0.3 = 0.24

**Path 2: Fail first written, pass second written, pass practical**
P(W₁F ∩ W₂P ∩ PP) = 0.2 × 0.6 × 0.3 = 0.036

**Total probability of gaining place**
P(gain place) = 0.24 + 0.036 = 0.276

**Answer: 0.276 or 69/250**

### Part (c) [2 marks]
**P(pass first written | gain place)**

### Solution:
Using conditional probability formula:
P(W₁P | gain place) = P(W₁P ∩ gain place) / P(gain place)

From part (b):
- P(W₁P ∩ gain place) = 0.24
- P(gain place) = 0.276

P(W₁P | gain place) = 0.24/0.276 = 20/23 ≈ 0.870

**Answer: 20/23 or 0.870**

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**Estimate mean time**

### Solution:
**Step 1: Calculate midpoints**
- 0≤t<10: midpoint = 5
- 10≤t<20: midpoint = 15
- 20≤t<40: midpoint = 30
- 40≤t<60: midpoint = 50
- 60≤t<100: midpoint = 80

**Step 2: Calculate mean**
Mean = (16×5 + 54×15 + 78×30 + 32×50 + 20×80) / 200
     = (80 + 810 + 2340 + 1600 + 1600) / 200
     = 6430 / 200
     = 32.15

**Answer: 32.2 seconds**

### Part (c) [2 marks]
**Greatest possible value of interquartile range**

### Solution:
**Step 1: Find quartile positions**
- Total players = 200
- Q₁ position = 50th player
- Q₃ position = 150th player

**Step 2: Identify quartile classes**
Cumulative frequencies:
- Up to 10: 16
- Up to 20: 16 + 54 = 70
- Up to 40: 70 + 78 = 148
- Up to 60: 148 + 32 = 180

- Q₁ (50th player) is in class 10≤t<20
- Q₃ (150th player) is in class 40≤t<60

**Step 3: Maximum possible IQR**
Greatest possible Q₃ = 60 (upper bound of Q₃ class)
Smallest possible Q₁ = 10 (lower bound of Q₁ class)

Maximum IQR = 60 - 10 = 50

## Question 6 [9 marks total]
**Adults in Questa: 60% travel by car**

### Part (a) [3 marks]
**Sample of 12 adults: P(fewer than 10 travel by car)**

### Solution:
Let X = number who travel by car, X ~ B(12, 0.6)

P(X < 10) = P(X ≤ 9) = 1 - P(X ≥ 10) = 1 - [P(X=10) + P(X=11) + P(X=12)]

**Calculate individual probabilities:**
P(X=10) = ¹²C₁₀(0.6)¹⁰(0.4)² = 66 × (0.6)¹⁰ × (0.4)² = 0.063852
P(X=11) = ¹²C₁₁(0.6)¹¹(0.4)¹ = 12 × (0.6)¹¹ × (0.4)¹ = 0.017414
P(X=12) = ¹²C₁₂(0.6)¹²(0.4)⁰ = 1 × (0.6)¹² × 1 = 0.002177

P(X ≥ 10) = 0.063852 + 0.017414 + 0.002177 = 0.083443

P(X < 10) = 1 - 0.083443 = 0.917

**Answer: 0.917**

### Part (b) [5 marks]
**Sample of 150 adults: P(fewer than 81 travel by car) using approximation**

### Solution:
Let Y = number who travel by car, Y ~ B(150, 0.6)

**Step 1: Use normal approximation**
Mean μ = np = 150 × 0.6 = 90
Variance σ² = np(1-p) = 150 × 0.6 × 0.4 = 36
Standard deviation σ = √36 = 6

**Step 2: Apply continuity correction**
P(Y < 81) = P(Y ≤ 80) ≈ P(Z ≤ 80.5) using continuity correction

**Step 3: Standardize**
P(Z ≤ (80.5 - 90)/6) = P(Z ≤ -9.5/6) = P(Z ≤ -1.583)

**Step 4: Calculate probability**
P(Z ≤ -1.583) = 1 - Φ(1.583) = 1 - 0.9433 = 0.0567

**Answer: 0.0567**

### Part (c) [1 mark]
**Justify use of normal approximation**

### Solution:
For normal approximation to binomial to be valid:
- np = 150 × 0.6 = 90 > 5 ✓
- n(1-p) = 150 × 0.4 = 60 > 5 ✓

Both conditions are satisfied, so normal approximation is appropriate.

**Answer: np = 90 > 5 and n(1-p) = 60 > 5**

## Question 7 [9 marks total]
**Sharma's tins: 3 carrots, 2 peas, 2 sweetcorn. X = number of tins opened to get carrots.**

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Show P(X = 3) = 6/35**

### Solution:
For X = 3, Sharma opens 3 tins and the 3rd tin contains carrots.
This means the first 2 tins do not contain carrots.

**Step 1: Probability first tin is not carrots**
P(1st not carrot) = 4/7 (4 non-carrot tins out of 7 total)

**Step 2: Probability second tin is not carrots given first is not carrots**
P(2nd not carrot | 1st not carrot) = 3/6 (3 non-carrot tins out of 6 remaining)

**Step 3: Probability third tin is carrots given first two are not carrots**
P(3rd carrot | first 2 not carrot) = 3/5 (3 carrot tins out of 5 remaining)

**Step 4: Calculate P(X = 3)**
P(X = 3) = (4/7) × (3/6) × (3/5) = 36/210 = 6/35 ✓

### Part (b) [4 marks]
**Probability distribution table for X**

### Solution:
X can take values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (maximum 5 since there are 4 non-carrot tins)

**P(X = 1):** First tin is carrot
P(X = 1) = 3/7

**P(X = 2):** First not carrot, second is carrot
P(X = 2) = (4/7) × (3/6) = 12/42 = 2/7 = 10/35

**P(X = 3):** From part (a)
P(X = 3) = 6/35

**P(X = 4):** First 3 not carrot, 4th is carrot
P(X = 4) = (4/7) × (3/6) × (2/5) × (3/4) = 72/840 = 3/35

**P(X = 5):** First 4 not carrot, 5th is carrot
P(X = 5) = (4/7) × (3/6) × (2/5) × (1/4) × (3/3) = 24/840 = 1/35

**Probability Distribution Table:**

| X | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P(X) | 15/35 | 10/35 | 6/35 | 3/35 | 1/35 |

### Part (c) [3 marks]
**Find Var(X)**

### Solution:
**Step 1: Calculate E(X)**
E(X) = 1×(15/35) + 2×(10/35) + 3×(6/35) + 4×(3/35) + 5×(1/35)
     = (15 + 20 + 18 + 12 + 5)/35
     = 70/35 = 2

**Step 2: Calculate E(X²)**
E(X²) = 1²×(15/35) + 2²×(10/35) + 3²×(6/35) + 4²×(3/35) + 5²×(1/35)
      = (15 + 40 + 54 + 48 + 25)/35
      = 182/35

**Step 3: Calculate Var(X)**
Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]²
       = 182/35 - (2)²
       = 182/35 - 4
       = 182/35 - 140/35
       = 42/35 = 6/5

**Answer: Var(X) = 6/5**
