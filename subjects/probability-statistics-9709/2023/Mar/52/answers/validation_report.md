- ✅ Correct identification of scenarios
- ✅ Biased coin (0.6) + three fair coins (0.5) approach
- ✅ Calculation: 0.075 + 0.15 = 0.225

**Part (b) - Complete Probability Table [2/2]**

- ✅ P(X = 3) = 0.275 correctly calculated

**Part (c) - Variance [2/2]**
- ✅ E(X²) = 5.4 correctly calculated
- ✅ Var(X) = 5.4 - (2.1)² = 0.99

### Question 3: Binomial and Related Distributions ✅ CORRECT
**Marks Achieved:** 6/6

**Part (a) - Binomial Distribution [3/3]**
- ✅ X ~ B(20, 0.8) correctly identified
- ✅ P(X > 17) = P(X = 18) + P(X = 19) + P(X = 20)
- ✅ Final answer: 0.206 (within acceptable range)

**Part (b) - Geometric Distribution [1/1]**
- ✅ P(5th person first not in favour) = (0.8)⁴ × 0.2 = 0.08192

- ✅ Answer: 0.0786 (within acceptable range)

### Question 4: Probability Tree Problem ✅ CORRECT
**Marks Achieved:** 3/3

- ✅ Correct equation setup: (1-x) × 0.7 × 0.9 = 0.36
- ✅ Algebraic manipulation: (1-x) × 0.63 = 0.36
- ✅ Final answer: x = 3/7 (0.428571...)

### Question 5: Independence Test ❌ INCORRECT
**Marks Achieved:** 0/3

**Critical Errors Identified:**
1. **Fundamental Misunderstanding:** The solution treats this as a marble arrangement problem, but the mark scheme indicates this is about probability calculations with specific values.

2. **Incorrect Probability Values:** 
   - Mark scheme shows P(A) = 1/2, P(B) = 1/243, P(A∩B) = 1/6
   - Solution incorrectly calculates P(B) = 1/4 and other values

3. **Wrong Independence Conclusion:** 
   - Mark scheme shows P(A) × P(B) = 1/2 × 1/243 = 1/486 ≠ P(A∩B) = 1/6
   - Therefore events should be DEPENDENT, not independent
   - Solution incorrectly concludes independence

**Required Correction:** Complete rework needed to match mark scheme approach and values.

### Question 6: Normal Distribution ✅ CORRECT
**Marks Achieved:** 11/11

**Part (a) - Basic Normal Probability [2/2]**
- ✅ Standardization: Z = (74-62.3)/8.4 = 1.393
- ✅ Answer: 0.918 (within acceptable range)

**Part (b) - Independent Events [4/4]**
- ✅ Range probability: P(-1.464 < Z < 1.393) = 0.847
- ✅ Fourth power: (0.847)⁴ = 0.514
- ✅ All method and accuracy marks earned

**Part (c) - Parameter Estimation [5/5]**
- ✅ Critical values: z₁ = -0.739, z₂ = 1.282
- ✅ Equation setup and solving methodology correct
- ✅ Final answers: μ = 42.6, σ = 8.91

### Question 7: Combinatorics ❌ PARTIALLY INCORRECT
**Marks Achieved:** 8/12

**Part (a) - Arrangements with Constraints [4/4]**
- ✅ Correct approach: Total with Es together minus those with both Es and Ds together
- ✅ Calculations: 7!/2! - 6! = 2520 - 720 = 1800
- ✅ All marks earned

**Part (b) - Probability Calculation [2/5]**
- ✅ Method marks earned for attempting systematic approach
- ❌ **Critical Error:** Final calculation incorrect
- **Mark Scheme Values:** 40320 favorable arrangements, total 362880, probability = 1/9
- **Solution Error:** Inconsistent calculations and incorrect final probability

**Part (c) - Letter Selection [2/3]**
- ✅ Correct identification of constraint (at least 1D and 1E)
- ❌ **Critical Error:** Final answer should be 25, not 99
- **Mark Scheme Approach:** Uses specific scenario counting method
- **Required:** Complete recalculation using mark scheme methodology
