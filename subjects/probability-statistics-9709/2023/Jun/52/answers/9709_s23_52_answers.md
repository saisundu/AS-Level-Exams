## Question 1 (6 marks)

### Part (a) - Probability Distribution Table [3 marks]

**Given:** X takes values -2, 2, 3 with P(X = x) = k(x² - 1)

**Solution:**
First, find k using the fact that probabilities sum to 1:
P(X = -2) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) = 1

For x = -2: P(X = -2) = k((-2)² - 1) = k(4 - 1) = 3k
For x = 2: P(X = 2) = k(2² - 1) = k(4 - 1) = 3k  
For x = 3: P(X = 3) = k(3² - 1) = k(9 - 1) = 8k

Sum: 3k + 3k + 8k = 14k = 1
Therefore: k = 1/14

**Probability Distribution Table:**
| x | -2 | 2 | 3 |
|---|----|----|---|
| P(X = x) | 3/14 | 3/14 | 8/14 |

**Marks awarded:** B1 + B1 + B1 = 3 marks

### Part (b) - Expected Value and Variance [3 marks]

**Solution:**

**Expected Value:**
E(X) = (-2)(3/14) + (2)(3/14) + (3)(8/14)
E(X) = -6/14 + 6/14 + 24/14 = 24/14 = 12/7

**Variance:**
E(X²) = (-2)²(3/14) + (2)²(3/14) + (3)²(8/14)
E(X²) = 4(3/14) + 4(3/14) + 9(8/14)
E(X²) = 12/14 + 12/14 + 72/14 = 96/14 = 48/7

Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]²
Var(X) = 48/7 - (12/7)²
Var(X) = 48/7 - 144/49 = 336/49 - 144/49 = 192/49

## Question 2 (6 marks)

### Part (a) - No Rain for 4 Days [1 mark]

**Solution:**
P(no rain on Sunday) = 0.6
P(no rain on Monday | no rain on Sunday) = 0.8
P(no rain on Tuesday | no rain on Monday) = 0.8
P(no rain on Wednesday | no rain on Tuesday) = 0.8

P(no rain for 4 days) = 0.6 × 0.8 × 0.8 × 0.8 = 0.6 × (0.8)³ = 0.3072

**Marks awarded:** B1 = 1 mark

### Part (b) - First Rain on Tuesday [2 marks]

**Solution:**
For first rain on Tuesday: No rain Sunday, No rain Monday, Rain Tuesday

P(no rain Sunday) = 0.6
P(no rain Monday | no rain Sunday) = 0.8
P(rain Tuesday | no rain Monday) = 0.2

P(first rain on Tuesday) = 0.6 × 0.8 × 0.2 = 0.096

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 = 2 marks

### Part (c) - Rain on Exactly One Day [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Four scenarios for exactly one day of rain:

**Rain on Sunday only (RDDD):**
P = 0.4 × 0.3 × 0.8 × 0.8 = 0.0768

**Rain on Monday only (DRDD):**
P = 0.6 × 0.2 × 0.3 × 0.8 = 0.0288

**Rain on Tuesday only (DDRD):**
P = 0.6 × 0.8 × 0.2 × 0.3 = 0.0288

**Rain on Wednesday only (DDDR):**
P = 0.6 × 0.8 × 0.8 × 0.2 = 0.0768

Total probability = 0.0768 + 0.0288 + 0.0288 + 0.0768 = 0.2112

**Marks awarded:** B1 + M1 + A1 = 3 marks

## Question 3 (7 marks)

### Part (a) - Median and IQR for Company A [3 marks]

**Solution:**
From the stem-and-leaf diagram for Company A:
Data in ascending order: 2500, 2510, 2511, 2514, 2520, 2524, 2526, 2528, 2540, 2542, 2544, 2546, 2548, 2560, 2571, 2573, 2574, 2576, 2576, 2578, 2578, 2580, 2582, 2585, 2589, 2595, 2598, 3010

n = 27, so median is the 14th value = 2710

Q1 position = 7th value = 2610
Q3 position = 21st value = 2840

IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 2840 - 2610 = 230

**Marks awarded:** B1 + M1 + A1 = 3 marks

### Part (b) - Box-and-Whisker Plots [3 marks]

**Solution:**
**Company A:** Min = 2500, Q1 = 2610, Median = 2710, Q3 = 2840, Max = 3010
**Company B:** Min = 2540, Q1 = 2600, Median = 2690, Q3 = 2780, Max = 3090

Draw two box-and-whisker plots on the same scale showing:
- Proper boxes with quartiles
- Median lines within boxes
- Whiskers extending to min/max values
- Clear labeling for companies A and B
- Appropriate scale (at least 1cm = $100)

**Marks awarded:** B1 + B1 + B1 = 3 marks

### Part (c) - Mean vs Median Comparison [1 mark]

**Solution:**
The mean would be less appropriate than the median because Company B has an extreme value at $3090, which would unduly influence the mean and make it less representative of the typical salary.

**Marks awarded:** B1 = 1 mark

## Question 4 (9 marks)

### Part (a) - P(X = 4) [1 mark]

**Solution:**
X follows a geometric distribution with p = 1/5

P(X = 4) = (4/5)³ × (1/5) = (64/125) × (1/5) = 64/625 = 0.1024

**Marks awarded:** B1 = 1 mark

### Part (b) - P(X < 6) [2 marks]

**Solution:**
P(X < 6) = P(X ≤ 5) = 1 - P(X > 5) = 1 - (4/5)⁵
P(X < 6) = 1 - 1024/3125 = 2101/3125 = 0.672

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 = 2 marks

### Part (c) - Conditional Probability [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Need P(score > 0 | score ≠ 2)

**Finding P(score > 0 and score ≠ 2):**
Total outcomes = 25
Score = 0: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5) → 5 outcomes
Score = 2: (1,3), (3,1), (2,4), (4,2), (3,5), (5,3) → 6 outcomes
Score > 0 and score ≠ 2: 25 - 5 - 6 = 14 outcomes

**Finding P(score ≠ 2):**
P(score ≠ 2) = (25 - 6)/25 = 19/25

**Conditional probability:**
P(score > 0 | score ≠ 2) = (14/25)/(19/25) = 14/19 ≈ 0.737

**Marks awarded:** M1 + M1 + A1 = 3 marks

### Part (d) - Binomial Distribution [3 marks]

**Solution:**
P(score > 2) = 6/25 (from counting outcomes where difference > 2)

For 9 spins, X ~ B(9, 6/25)
P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X ≤ 2)
= 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)]
= 1 - [C(9,0)(6/25)⁰(19/25)⁹ + C(9,1)(6/25)¹(19/25)⁸ + C(9,2)(6/25)²(19/25)⁷]
= 1 - [0.08459 + 0.2404 + 0.3037]
= 1 - 0.6287 = 0.371

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 + B1 = 3 marks

## Question 5 (12 marks)

### Part (a) - Normal Distribution Application [4 marks]

**Given:** Western bluebirds ~ N(16.5, 0.6²), sample size = 150

**Solution:**
P(15.4 < X < 16.8) = P((15.4-16.5)/0.6 < Z < (16.8-16.5)/0.6)
P(15.4 < X < 16.8) = P(-1.833 < Z < 0.5)
P(15.4 < X < 16.8) = Φ(0.5) - Φ(-1.833) = Φ(0.5) - (1 - Φ(1.833))
P(15.4 < X < 16.8) = 0.6915 - (1 - 0.9666) = 0.6915 + 0.9666 - 1 = 0.6581

Expected number = 150 × 0.6581 = 98.7 ≈ 99 birds

**Marks awarded:** M1 + M1 + A1 + B1 = 4 marks

### Part (b) - Finding Standard Deviation [3 marks]

**Given:** Eastern bluebirds ~ N(18.4, σ²), 72% have length > 17.1cm

**Solution:**
P(X > 17.1) = 0.72
P(Z > (17.1 - 18.4)/σ) = 0.72
P(Z < (17.1 - 18.4)/σ) = 0.28

From tables: (17.1 - 18.4)/σ = -0.583
-1.3/σ = -0.583
σ = 1.3/0.583 = 2.23

**Marks awarded:** B1 + M1 + A1 = 3 marks

### Part (c) - Normal Approximation [5 marks]

**Solution:**
For 120 Eastern bluebirds, let Y = number with length > 17.1cm
Y ~ B(120, 0.72)

Mean = 120 × 0.72 = 86.4
Variance = 120 × 0.72 × 0.28 = 24.192

Using normal approximation: Y ~ N(86.4, 24.192)

P(Y < 80) = P(Y ≤ 79.5) with continuity correction
= P(Z ≤ (79.5 - 86.4)/√24.192)
= P(Z ≤ -1.403)
= 1 - 0.9196 = 0.0804

**Marks awarded:** B1 + M1 + M1 + M1 + A1 = 5 marks

## Question 6 (10 marks)

### Part (a) - Team Selection with Constraints [4 marks]

**Solution:**
Need exactly 1 swimmer, at least 4 cyclists, at most 2 runners.

**Case 1: 1S + 4C + 2R**
C(6,1) × C(8,4) × C(11,2) = 6 × 70 × 55 = 23,100

**Case 2: 1S + 5C + 1R**
C(6,1) × C(8,5) × C(11,1) = 6 × 56 × 11 = 3,696

**Case 3: 1S + 6C + 0R**
C(6,1) × C(8,6) × C(11,0) = 6 × 28 × 1 = 168

Total = 23,100 + 3,696 + 168 = 26,964

**Marks awarded:** M1 + B1 + M1 + A1 = 4 marks

### Part (b) - Arrangements with Groups Together [2 marks]

**Solution:**
2 swimmers together, 3 cyclists together, 4 runners together.

Treat each sport as a unit: 3 units can be arranged in 3! ways
Within each unit:
- Swimmers: 2! arrangements
- Cyclists: 3! arrangements  
- Runners: 4! arrangements

Total arrangements = 3! × 2! × 3! × 4! = 6 × 2 × 6 × 24 = 1,728

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 = 2 marks

### Part (c) - No Cyclists Adjacent [4 marks]

**Solution:**
First arrange the 6 non-cyclists (2 swimmers + 4 runners): 6! ways

This creates 7 gaps where cyclists can be placed.
Choose 3 of these 7 gaps: C(7,3) = 35 ways
Arrange the 3 cyclists in chosen gaps: 3! ways

Total arrangements = 6! × C(7,3) × 3! = 720 × 35 × 6 = 151,200

**Marks awarded:** M1 + M1 + M1 + A1 = 4 marks
