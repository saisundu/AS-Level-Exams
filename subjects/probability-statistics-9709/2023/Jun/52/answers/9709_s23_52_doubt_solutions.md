## Question 1: Probability Distribution with Quadratic Function

**Context**: Random variable X takes values -2, 2, and 3 with P(X = x) = k(x² - 1), where k is a constant.

### Part (a): Probability distribution table

**Problem**: Draw up the probability distribution table for X, giving probabilities as numerical fractions.

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Calculate probabilities in terms of k
- For x = -2: P(X = -2) = k((-2)² - 1) = k(4 - 1) = 3k
- For x = 2: P(X = 2) = k(2² - 1) = k(4 - 1) = 3k  
- For x = 3: P(X = 3) = k(3² - 1) = k(9 - 1) = 8k

**Step 2**: Use the fact that probabilities sum to 1
3k + 3k + 8k = 1
14k = 1
k = 1/14

**Step 3**: Calculate actual probabilities
- P(X = -2) = 3k = 3/14
- P(X = 2) = 3k = 3/14
- P(X = 3) = 8k = 8/14 = 4/7

**Probability Distribution Table**:

| x | -2 | 2 | 3 |
|---|----|----|---|
| P(X = x) | 3/14 | 3/14 | 8/14 |

### Part (b): Expected value and variance

**Problem**: Find E(X) and Var(X).

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Calculate E(X)
E(X) = Σ x·P(X = x)
E(X) = (-2)(3/14) + (2)(3/14) + (3)(8/14)
E(X) = -6/14 + 6/14 + 24/14
E(X) = 24/14 = **12/7**

**Step 2**: Calculate E(X²)
E(X²) = Σ x²·P(X = x)
E(X²) = (-2)²(3/14) + (2)²(3/14) + (3)²(8/14)
E(X²) = 4(3/14) + 4(3/14) + 9(8/14)
E(X²) = 12/14 + 12/14 + 72/14 = 96/14 = 48/7

**Step 3**: Calculate Var(X) using Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]²
Var(X) = 48/7 - (12/7)²
Var(X) = 48/7 - 144/49
Var(X) = (48×7 - 144)/49 = (336 - 144)/49 = 192/49

**Final Answers**:
- **E(X) = 12/7**
- **Var(X) = 192/49**

## Question 4: Geometric Distribution and Conditional Probability

**Context**: Fair 5-sided spinner with sides 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Variable X denotes number of spins needed to get a 2.

### Part (a): P(X = 4)

**Problem**: Find P(X = 4).

**Solution**:

This follows a geometric distribution where:
- Success = getting a 2, p = 1/5
- Failure = not getting a 2, (1-p) = 4/5

For exactly 4 spins to be needed:
- First 3 spins must be failures: (4/5)³
- 4th spin must be success: 1/5

P(X = 4) = (4/5)³ × (1/5) = 64/125 × 1/5 = **64/625**

### Part (b): P(X < 6)

**Problem**: Find P(X < 6).

**Solution**:

**Method 1**: Using geometric series formula
P(X < 6) = P(X ≤ 5) = 1 - P(X > 5) = 1 - (4/5)⁵
P(X < 6) = 1 - 1024/3125 = (3125 - 1024)/3125 = **2101/3125**

**Method 2**: Direct calculation
P(X < 6) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5)
= (1/5) + (4/5)(1/5) + (4/5)²(1/5) + (4/5)³(1/5) + (4/5)⁴(1/5)
= 1/5 + 4/25 + 16/125 + 64/625 + 256/3125
= (625 + 500 + 400 + 320 + 256)/3125 = **2101/3125**

### Part (c): Conditional probability with two spinners

**Problem**: Two 5-sided spinners spun simultaneously. Score = 0 if equal, otherwise higher - lower. Find P(score > 0 | score ≠ 2).

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Analyze all possible outcomes (25 total)
For spinners showing (a,b):
- Score = 0: When a = b → (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5) → 5 outcomes
- Score = 1: |a-b| = 1 → 8 outcomes  
- Score = 2: |a-b| = 2 → 6 outcomes
- Score = 3: |a-b| = 3 → 4 outcomes
- Score = 4: |a-b| = 4 → 2 outcomes

**Step 2**: Identify relevant probabilities
- P(score > 0) = P(score = 1,2,3,4) = (8+6+4+2)/25 = 20/25
- P(score ≠ 2) = P(score = 0,1,3,4) = (5+8+4+2)/25 = 19/25
- P(score > 0 ∩ score ≠ 2) = P(score = 1,3,4) = (8+4+2)/25 = 14/25

**Step 3**: Apply conditional probability formula
P(score > 0 | score ≠ 2) = P(score > 0 ∩ score ≠ 2) / P(score ≠ 2)
= (14/25) / (19/25) = 14/19

**Answer**: **14/19**

### Part (d): Binomial probability

**Problem**: For 9 spins of two spinners, find P(score > 2 on at least 3 occasions).

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Find P(score > 2) for one double spin
P(score > 2) = P(score = 3 or 4) = (4+2)/25 = 6/25

**Step 2**: Set up binomial distribution
X ~ B(9, 6/25) where X = number of times score > 2

**Step 3**: Calculate P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X ≤ 2)
P(X ≤ 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)

P(X = 0) = C(9,0)(6/25)⁰(19/25)⁹ = (19/25)⁹
P(X = 1) = C(9,1)(6/25)¹(19/25)⁸ = 9 × (6/25) × (19/25)⁸  
P(X = 2) = C(9,2)(6/25)²(19/25)⁷ = 36 × (6/25)² × (19/25)⁷

**Step 4**: Calculate final answer
P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)]
= 1 - 0.6285 = **0.371**
