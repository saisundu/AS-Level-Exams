## Question 1 (4 marks)

### Part (a) - Standard Deviation [2 marks]

**Given:**
- n = 50 values
- Σ(x - q) = 700
- Σ(x - q)² = 14,235

**Solution:**
Using the variance formula:
Var(x) = [Σ(x - q)²]/n - [Σ(x - q)/n]²

Var(x) = 14,235/50 - (700/50)²
Var(x) = 284.7 - (14)²
Var(x) = 284.7 - 196 = 88.7

Standard deviation = √88.7 = 9.42

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 = 2 marks

### Part (b) - Value of q [2 marks]

**Given:** Σx = 2865

**Solution:**
From Σ(x - q) = 700:
Σx - nq = 700
2865 - 50q = 700
50q = 2865 - 700 = 2165
q = 2165/50 = 43.3

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 = 2 marks

## Question 2 (5 marks)

### Part (a) - Committee Selection [2 marks]

**Solution:**
Need to choose 3 men from 6 men and 3 women from 8 women.

Number of ways = C(6,3) × C(8,3)
= 20 × 56 = 1120

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 = 2 marks

### Part (b) - Committee with Brother Restriction [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Total people: 6 men + 8 women = 14 people
Restriction: No more than 2 of the 3 brothers

**Method 1 - Direct counting:**
- 0 brothers: C(3,0) × C(11,6) = 1 × 462 = 462
- 1 brother: C(3,1) × C(11,5) = 3 × 462 = 1386  
- 2 brothers: C(3,2) × C(11,4) = 3 × 330 = 990

Total = 462 + 1386 + 990 = 2838

**Method 2 - Complementary counting:**
Total ways without restriction = C(14,6) = 3003
Ways with all 3 brothers = C(3,3) × C(11,3) = 1 × 165 = 165
Ways with at most 2 brothers = 3003 - 165 = 2838

**Marks awarded:** B1 + M1 + A1 = 3 marks

## Question 3 (6 marks)

### Part (a) - Arrangements of COCOONED [1 mark]

**Solution:**
Letters: C, O, C, O, O, N, E, D
Total letters = 8
Repeated letters: C appears 2 times, O appears 3 times

Number of arrangements = 8!/(2! × 3!) = 40320/(2 × 6) = 3360

**Marks awarded:** B1 = 1 mark

### Part (b) - Arrangements with O first and N last [2 marks]

**Solution:**
Fix O in first position and N in last position.
Remaining letters to arrange: C, C, O, O, E, D (6 letters)
Repeated letters: C appears 2 times, O appears 2 times

Number of arrangements = 6!/(2! × 2!) = 720/(2 × 2) = 180

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 = 2 marks

### Part (c) - Conditional Probability [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Need P(all three Os together | two Cs are next to each other)

**Finding P(two Cs next to each other):**
Treat CC as one unit: (CC), O, O, O, N, E, D (7 units)
Arrangements = 7!/3! = 5040/6 = 840

**Finding P(all three Os together AND two Cs next to each other):**
Treat CC as one unit and OOO as one unit: (CC), (OOO), N, E, D (5 units)
Arrangements = 5! = 120

**Conditional probability:**
P(all three Os together | two Cs next to each other) = 120/840 = 1/7 ≈ 0.143

**Marks awarded:** M1 + M1 + A1 = 3 marks

## Question 4 (9 marks)

### Part (a) - Normal Distribution Application [4 marks]

**Given:** Times ~ N(14.6, 5.2²), sample size = 250

**Solution:**
P(X > 20) = P(Z > (20 - 14.6)/5.2) = P(Z > 1.038)
P(Z > 1.038) = 1 - Φ(1.038) = 1 - 0.8504 = 0.1496

Expected number = 250 × 0.1496 = 37.4 ≈ 37 students

**Marks awarded:** M1 + M1 + A1 + B1 = 4 marks

### Part (b) - Finding Parameters [5 marks]

**Given:** 
- Times ~ N(μ, σ²)
- 20% have times < 14.5 minutes
- 67% have times > 18.5 minutes

**Solution:**
From 20% < 14.5: P(Z < (14.5 - μ)/σ) = 0.20
From tables: (14.5 - μ)/σ = -0.842
Therefore: 14.5 - μ = -0.842σ ... (1)

From 67% > 18.5: P(Z > (18.5 - μ)/σ) = 0.67
P(Z < (18.5 - μ)/σ) = 0.33
From tables: (18.5 - μ)/σ = -0.44
Therefore: 18.5 - μ = -0.44σ ... (2)

Solving equations (1) and (2):
From (1): μ = 14.5 + 0.842σ
From (2): μ = 18.5 + 0.44σ

14.5 + 0.842σ = 18.5 + 0.44σ
0.402σ = 4
σ = 9.95

μ = 14.5 + 0.842(9.95) = 22.9

**Marks awarded:** B1 + B1 + M1 + M1 + A1 = 5 marks

## Question 5 (7 marks)

### Part (a) - Histogram [4 marks]

**Given data:**
| Population | 100-800 | 900-1200 | 1300-2000 | 2100-3200 | 3300-4800 |
|------------|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Frequency  | 8       | 12        | 50        | 48        | 32        |

**Solution:**
Class widths: 700, 300, 700, 1100, 1500
Frequency densities: 8/700=0.0114, 12/300=0.04, 50/700=0.0714, 48/1100=0.0436, 32/1500=0.0213

Histogram drawn with:
- Horizontal axis: Population (50 to 4850)
- Vertical axis: Frequency density (0 to 0.08)
- Bars at correct heights and widths

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 + B1 + B1 = 4 marks

### Part (b) - Median Class [1 mark]

**Solution:**
Total frequency = 150
Median position = 75th value

Cumulative frequencies: 8, 20, 70, 118, 150
The 75th value falls in the class 2100-3200

**Marks awarded:** B1 = 1 mark

### Part (c) - Maximum Interquartile Range [2 marks]

**Solution:**
Q1 position = 37.5th value (falls in 1300-2000 class)
Q3 position = 112.5th value (falls in 2100-3200 class)

For maximum IQR:
- Q1 minimum = 1250 (start of class)
- Q3 maximum = 3249 (end of class)

Maximum IQR = 3249 - 1250 = 1999

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 = 2 marks

## Question 6 (11 marks)

### Part (a) - Show P(X = 3) = 3/64 [2 marks]

**Solution:**
X ~ B(4, 1/4) where X = number of 2s

P(X = 3) = C(4,3) × (1/4)³ × (3/4)¹
= 4 × (1/64) × (3/4)
= 12/64 × 1/4 = 3/64 ✓

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 = 2 marks

### Part (b) - Complete Probability Table [2 marks]

**Solution:**
P(X = 1) = C(4,1) × (1/4)¹ × (3/4)³ = 4 × (1/4) × (27/64) = 27/64
P(X = 2) = C(4,2) × (1/4)² × (3/4)² = 6 × (1/16) × (9/16) = 54/256 = 27/128

**Complete table:**
| x | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P(X=x) | 81/256 | 27/64 | 27/128 | 3/64 | 1/256 |

**Marks awarded:** B1 + B1 = 2 marks

### Part (c) - Expected Value [2 marks]

**Solution:**
E(X) = 0×(81/256) + 1×(27/64) + 2×(27/128) + 3×(3/64) + 4×(1/256)
= 0 + 27/64 + 54/128 + 9/64 + 4/256
= 0 + 108/256 + 108/256 + 36/256 + 4/256
= 256/256 = 1

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 = 2 marks

### Part (d) - Normal Approximation [5 marks]

**Solution:**
For 96 occasions, let Y = number of times getting at least 2 twos
P(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X ≤ 1) = 1 - (81/256 + 27/64) = 1 - 189/256 = 67/256

Y ~ B(96, 67/256)
Mean = 96 × (67/256) = 25.125
Variance = 96 × (67/256) × (189/256) = 18.549

Using normal approximation: Y ~ N(25.125, 18.549)

P(Y < 20) = P(Y ≤ 19.5) with continuity correction
= P(Z ≤ (19.5 - 25.125)/√18.549)
= P(Z ≤ -1.306)
= 1 - 0.9042 = 0.0958

**Marks awarded:** B1 + M1 + M1 + M1 + A1 = 5 marks

## Question 7 (8 marks)

### Part (a) - Geometric Distribution [2 marks]

**Solution:**
P(first elephant before 6th Monday) = P(X ≤ 5) where X ~ Geo(1/5)

P(X ≤ 5) = 1 - (4/5)⁵ = 1 - 1024/3125 = 2101/3125 = 0.672

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 = 2 marks

### Part (b) - Binomial Distribution [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Let X = number of leopards in 12 magazines
X ~ B(12, 1/5)

P(X > 2) = 1 - P(X ≤ 2)
= 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)]
= 1 - [C(12,0)(1/5)⁰(4/5)¹² + C(12,1)(1/5)¹(4/5)¹¹ + C(12,2)(1/5)²(4/5)¹⁰]
= 1 - [0.06872 + 0.20615 + 0.28347]
= 1 - 0.55834 = 0.442

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 + B1 = 3 marks

### Part (c) - Multinomial Distribution [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Need exactly one of each of 5 animals in 5 weeks.

P(exactly one of each) = (5!)/(1!1!1!1!1!) × (1/5)⁵
= 5! × (1/5)⁵
= 120 × (1/3125)
= 120/3125 = 24/625 = 0.0384

**Marks awarded:** M1 + M1 + A1 = 3 marks
