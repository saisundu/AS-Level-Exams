## Question 2: Committee Selection with Constraints

### Part (a): Committee of 6 with exactly 3 men and 3 women

**Problem**: Find the number of ways to choose a committee of 6 people from 6 men and 8 women if it must include exactly 3 men and 3 women.

**Solution**:

**Method**: Use combination formula for each gender separately

**Step 1**: Choose 3 men from 6 men
Number of ways = C(6,3) = 6!/(3!×3!) = 20

**Step 2**: Choose 3 women from 8 women  
Number of ways = C(8,3) = 8!/(3!×5!) = 56

**Step 3**: Apply multiplication principle
Total ways = C(6,3) × C(8,3) = 20 × 56 = **1120**

### Part (b): Committee of 6 with no more than 2 brothers (from 3 brothers among the men)

**Problem**: Find the number of ways to choose a committee of 6 people from 6 men and 8 women, where 3 of the men are brothers, with the constraint that no more than 2 brothers can be selected.

**Solution**:

**Method 1**: Count by cases based on number of brothers selected

**Available people**: 3 brothers + 3 other men + 8 women = 14 total
**Remaining non-brothers**: 3 other men + 8 women = 11 people

**Case 1**: 0 brothers selected
- Choose 0 from 3 brothers: C(3,0) = 1
- Choose 6 from remaining 11 people: C(11,6) = 462
- Ways: 1 × 462 = 462

**Case 2**: 1 brother selected
- Choose 1 from 3 brothers: C(3,1) = 3
- Choose 5 from remaining 11 people: C(11,5) = 462
- Ways: 3 × 462 = 1386

**Case 3**: 2 brothers selected
- Choose 2 from 3 brothers: C(3,2) = 3
- Choose 4 from remaining 11 people: C(11,4) = 330
- Ways: 3 × 330 = 990

**Total ways** = 462 + 1386 + 990 = **2838**

**Method 2**: Total minus unwanted cases
- Total ways to choose 6 from 14: C(14,6) = 3003
- Ways with all 3 brothers: C(11,3) = 165
- Required = 3003 - 165 = **2838**

## Question 5: Histogram and Population Statistics

**Context**: Populations of 150 villages (to nearest hundred) with frequency distribution:

| Population | 100-800 | 900-1200 | 1300-2000 | 2100-3200 | 3300-4800 |
|------------|---------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Villages   | 8       | 12       | 50        | 48        | 32        |

### Part (a): Draw histogram

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Calculate class widths and frequency densities

| Class | Lower Bound | Upper Bound | Class Width | Frequency | Frequency Density |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 100-800 | 50 | 850 | 800 | 8 | 8/800 = 0.01 |
| 900-1200 | 850 | 1250 | 400 | 12 | 12/400 = 0.03 |
| 1300-2000 | 1250 | 2050 | 800 | 50 | 50/800 = 0.0625 |
| 2100-3200 | 2050 | 3250 | 1200 | 48 | 48/1200 = 0.04 |
| 3300-4800 | 3250 | 4850 | 1600 | 32 | 32/1600 = 0.02 |

**Step 2**: Histogram requirements
- Horizontal axis: Population (50 to 4850)
- Vertical axis: Frequency Density (0 to 0.0625)
- Bar heights match frequency densities calculated above
- Bars positioned at class boundaries with no gaps

### Part (b): Class interval containing the median

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Find median position
For 150 villages, median position = (150 + 1)/2 = 75.5
So we need the 75th and 76th values.

**Step 2**: Find cumulative frequencies
- Up to 850: 8 villages
- Up to 1250: 8 + 12 = 20 villages  
- Up to 2050: 20 + 50 = 70 villages
- Up to 3250: 70 + 48 = 118 villages

**Step 3**: Locate median
The 75th and 76th values fall in the interval where cumulative frequency first exceeds 75.
Since we have 70 villages up to 2050, and 118 villages up to 3250, the 75th and 76th values are in the interval **2100-3200**.

**Answer**: 2100-3200 (or 2050-3250 using class boundaries)

### Part (c): Greatest possible value of interquartile range

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Find quartile positions
- Q1 position: (150 + 1)/4 = 37.75 → need 38th value
- Q3 position: 3(150 + 1)/4 = 113.25 → need 113th value

**Step 2**: Locate quartiles using cumulative frequencies
From cumulative frequencies calculated above:
- 38th value is in interval 1300-2000 (between 20th and 70th values)
- 113th value is in interval 2100-3200 (between 70th and 118th values)

**Step 3**: Maximum IQR calculation
For maximum IQR:
- Q1 should be as small as possible → at lower boundary of its interval = 1250
- Q3 should be as large as possible → at upper boundary of its interval = 3250

**Maximum IQR** = 3250 - 1250 = **2000**

**Alternative calculation**: 3249 - 1250 = **1999** (using discrete boundaries)
