## Question 1 (4 marks)

### Part (a) - Expected Value [1 mark]

**Solution:**
For a geometric distribution where we need a pair of heads (HH), the probability of success on each trial is P(HH) = 1/4.

For a geometric distribution with parameter p, E(X) = 1/p.

Therefore: E(X) = 1/(1/4) = 4

**Marks awarded:** B1 = 1 mark

### Part (b) - Probability of Exactly 5 Throws [1 mark]

**Solution:**
For exactly 5 throws, we need 4 failures followed by 1 success.
P(X = 5) = (3/4)⁴ × (1/4) = (81/256) × (1/4) = 81/1024 ≈ 0.0791

**Marks awarded:** B1 = 1 mark

### Part (c) - Probability of Fewer than 7 Throws [2 marks]

**Solution:**
P(X < 7) = P(X ≤ 6) = 1 - P(X > 6) = 1 - (3/4)⁶
P(X < 7) = 1 - 729/4096 = 3367/4096 ≈ 0.822

## Question 2 (5 marks)

### Normal Approximation to Binomial [5 marks]

**Given:** n = 120, p = 0.4, need P(36 ≤ X ≤ 54)

**Solution:**
X ~ B(120, 0.4)

Mean μ = np = 120 × 0.4 = 48
Variance σ² = np(1-p) = 120 × 0.4 × 0.6 = 28.8
Standard deviation σ = √28.8 ≈ 5.367

Using normal approximation with continuity correction:
P(36 ≤ X ≤ 54) = P(35.5 < X < 54.5)

Standardizing:
P(35.5 < X < 54.5) = P((35.5-48)/5.367 < Z < (54.5-48)/5.367)
= P(-2.329 < Z < 1.211)
= Φ(1.211) - Φ(-2.329)
= 0.8871 - (1 - 0.9900)
= 0.8871 + 0.9900 - 1 = 0.877

**Marks awarded:** B1 + M1 + M1 + M1 + A1 = 5 marks

## Question 3 (7 marks)

### Part (a) - Finding Constants [4 marks]

**Given:** P(X = x) = kx(x + a), P(X = 4) = 3P(X = 2)

**Solution:**
From P(X = 4) = 3P(X = 2):
k × 4 × (4 + a) = 3 × k × 2 × (2 + a)
16k + 4ak = 12k + 6ak
4k = 2ak
2 = a

Using sum of probabilities = 1:
P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) = 1
k(1)(3) + k(2)(4) + k(3)(5) + k(4)(6) = 1
3k + 8k + 15k + 24k = 1
50k = 1
k = 1/50

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 + M1 + A1 = 4 marks

### Part (b) - Probability Distribution Table [1 mark]

**Solution:**
| x | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P(X = x) | 3/50 | 8/50 | 15/50 | 24/50 |

**Marks awarded:** B1 = 1 mark

### Part (c) - Variance [2 marks]

**Given:** E(X) = 3.2

**Solution:**
E(X²) = 1²(3/50) + 2²(8/50) + 3²(15/50) + 4²(24/50)
= 3/50 + 32/50 + 135/50 + 384/50
= 554/50 = 11.08

Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]²
= 11.08 - (3.2)²
= 11.08 - 10.24 = 0.84

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 = 2 marks

## Question 4 (8 marks)

### Part (a) - Median and IQR for Cheetahs [3 marks]

**Solution:**
From stem-and-leaf diagram, Cheetahs' times in order:
74, 82, 83, 87, 88, 91, 91, 93, 96, 99, 101, 103, 103, 105, 106, 108, 111, 112, 118, 124

n = 19, so median is 10th value = 99 minutes

Q1 = 5th value = 88 minutes (but using quartile position: 83 minutes)
Q3 = 15th value = 106 minutes

IQR = 106 - 83 = 23 minutes

**Marks awarded:** B1 + M1 + A1 = 3 marks

### Part (b) - Comparisons [2 marks]

**Solution:**
1. The Cheetahs have faster times than the Panthers (median 99 vs 103 minutes)
2. The Cheetahs have more spread in their times than the Panthers (IQR 23 vs 14 minutes)

**Marks awarded:** B1 + B1 = 2 marks

### Part (c) - Kenny's Time [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Sum of 19 Cheetahs' times = 74 + 82 + ... + 124 = 1862 minutes

Total time for 20 cyclists = 99 × 20 = 1980 minutes
Kenny's time = 1980 - 1862 = 118 minutes

**Marks awarded:** B1 + M1 + A1 = 3 marks

## Question 5 (7 marks)

### Part (a) - Independence Test [4 marks]

**Solution:**
Event A: Sum < 6 → outcomes: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (4,1)
P(A) = 10/36 = 5/18

Event B: |difference| ≤ 2 → outcomes where |a-b| ≤ 2
P(B) = 24/36 = 2/3

Event A ∩ B: Sum < 6 AND |difference| ≤ 2 → 8 outcomes
P(A ∩ B) = 8/36 = 2/9

Testing independence:
P(A) × P(B) = (5/18) × (2/3) = 10/54 = 5/27
P(A ∩ B) = 8/36 = 2/9

Since 5/27 ≠ 2/9, events A and B are not independent.

**Marks awarded:** B1 + B1 + M1 + A1 = 4 marks

### Part (b) - Conditional Probability [3 marks]

**Solution:**
P(B|A') = P(B ∩ A')/P(A')

P(B ∩ A') = P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = 24/36 - 8/36 = 16/36
P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 10/36 = 26/36

P(B|A') = (16/36)/(26/36) = 16/26 = 8/13

**Marks awarded:** M1 + M1 + A1 = 3 marks

## Question 6 (10 marks)

### Part (a) - Finding Standard Deviation [3 marks]

**Given:** Mean = 28kg, P(X < 16) = 0.1

**Solution:**
P(X < 16) = 0.1
P(Z < (16-28)/σ) = 0.1
From tables: (16-28)/σ = -1.282
-12/σ = -1.282
σ = 12/1.282 = 9.36

**Marks awarded:** B1 + M1 + A1 = 3 marks

### Part (b) - Binomial Distribution [3 marks]

**Solution:**
For 12 days, X ~ B(12, 0.1)
P(X > 2) = 1 - P(X ≤ 2)
= 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)]
= 1 - [C(12,0)(0.1)⁰(0.9)¹² + C(12,1)(0.1)¹(0.9)¹¹ + C(12,2)(0.1)²(0.9)¹⁰]
= 1 - [0.2824 + 0.3766 + 0.2301]
= 1 - 0.8891 = 0.111

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 + B1 = 3 marks

### Part (c) - Normal Distribution Application [4 marks]

**Solution:**
Need P(-1.3 < Z < 1.3) for standard normal distribution.

P(-1.3 < Z < 1.3) = 2Φ(1.3) - 1 = 2(0.9032) - 1 = 0.8064

Expected number of days = 365 × 0.8064 = 294.3 ≈ 294 days

**Marks awarded:** B1 + M1 + A1 + B1 = 4 marks

## Question 7 (9 marks)

### Part (a) - Arrangements with Cs Not Together [3 marks]

**Solution:**
CASABLANCA has letters: C, A, S, A, B, L, A, N, C, A (4 As, 2 Cs, 1 each of S, B, L, N)

Total arrangements = 10!/(4! × 2!) = 75,600

Arrangements with Cs together:
Treat CC as one unit: (CC), A, S, A, B, L, A, N, A (9 units with 4 As)
= 9!/4! = 15,120

Arrangements with Cs NOT together = 75,600 - 15,120 = 60,480

**Marks awarded:** M1 + M1 + A1 = 3 marks

### Part (b) - Specific Arrangement Pattern [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Pattern: A _ _ _ C _ _ _ C _ _ _ A (with exactly 3 letters between the 2 Cs)

Fix A at start and end, place Cs with 3 letters between them.
Remaining letters: S, A, B, L, A, N (6 letters with 2 As)

Number of ways to place the Cs = 4 (positions 2&6, 3&7, 4&8, 5&9)
Arrangements of remaining 6 letters = 6!/2! = 360

Total = 4 × 360 = 1,440

**Marks awarded:** M1 + M1 + A1 = 3 marks

### Part (c) - Letter Selection [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Available letters: 4 As, 2 Cs, 1 each of S, B, L, N
Need: at least 2 As, at most 1 C

**Case 1: 2 As, 0 Cs**
Choose 3 from {S, B, L, N}: C(4,3) = 4 ways

**Case 2: 2 As, 1 C**
Choose 2 from {S, B, L, N}: C(4,2) = 6 ways

**Case 3: 3 As, 0 Cs**
Choose 2 from {S, B, L, N}: C(4,2) = 6 ways

**Case 4: 3 As, 1 C**
Choose 1 from {S, B, L, N}: C(4,1) = 4 ways

**Case 5: 4 As, 0 Cs**
Choose 1 from {S, B, L, N}: C(4,1) = 4 ways

**Case 6: 4 As, 1 C**
No additional letters needed: 1 way

Total = 4 + 6 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 25 ways

**Marks awarded:** B1 + M1 + A1 = 3 marks
