## Question 1 [4 marks]
**Topic: Cumulative Frequency Graphs**

120 children complete a puzzle. Times shown in cumulative frequency graph.

### Part (a) [2 marks]
Use graph to estimate interquartile range.

**Solution:**

From the cumulative frequency graph:
- Q₁ (25th percentile): 25% of 120 = 30 children → time ≈ 23.7 seconds
- Q₃ (75th percentile): 75% of 120 = 90 children → time ≈ 31 seconds

IQR = Q₃ - Q₁ = 31 - 23.7 = 7.3 seconds

**Answer:** 7.3 seconds

### Part (b) [2 marks]
35% took longer than T seconds. Find T.

**Solution:**

If 35% took longer than T seconds, then 65% took T seconds or less.
65% of 120 = 78 children

From graph, draw horizontal line at cumulative frequency = 78
Read down to time axis: T ≈ 28.5 seconds

**Answer:** T = 28.5 seconds

## Question 2 [7 marks]
**Topic: Geometric Distribution**

Hazeem throws two fair dice repeatedly. Score = sum of numbers.

### Part (a) [2 marks]
Find P(exactly 5 throws needed to get score ≥ 8).

**Solution:**

First, find P(score ≥ 8) on single throw:
Favorable outcomes for sum ≥ 8: (2,6), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)
Count: 15 outcomes out of 36 total
P(score ≥ 8) = 15/36 = 5/12

For geometric distribution: P(first success on trial n) = (1-p)^(n-1) × p
P(exactly 5 throws) = (7/12)⁴ × (5/12) = (2401/20736) × (5/12) = 12005/248832 ≈ 0.0482

**Answer:** 0.0482

### Part (b) [2 marks]
Find P(no more than 4 throws needed).

**Solution:**

P(X ≤ 4) = 1 - P(X > 4) = 1 - (7/12)⁴ = 1 - 2401/20736 = 18335/20736 ≈ 0.884

**Answer:** 0.884

### Part (c) [3 marks]
For 8 throws, find P(score ≥ 8 on fewer than 3 occasions).

**Solution:**

Let Y ~ B(8, 5/12)
P(Y < 3) = P(Y = 0) + P(Y = 1) + P(Y = 2)

P(Y = 0) = C(8,0)(5/12)⁰(7/12)⁸ = (7/12)⁸
P(Y = 1) = C(8,1)(5/12)¹(7/12)⁷ = 8 × (5/12) × (7/12)⁷
P(Y = 2) = C(8,2)(5/12)²(7/12)⁶ = 28 × (5/12)² × (7/12)⁶

P(Y < 3) = 0.01341 + 0.07661 + 0.1915 = 0.282

**Answer:** 0.282

## Question 3 [11 marks]
**Topic: Normal Distribution**

Egg weights: N(80.5, 6.6²). Small < 76g, 40% medium.

### Part (a) [3 marks]
Find percentage classified as small.

**Solution:**

Let X ~ N(80.5, 6.6²)
P(X < 76) = P(Z < (76 - 80.5)/6.6) = P(Z < -0.6818)
P(Z < -0.682) = 1 - Φ(0.682) = 1 - 0.7524 = 0.2476

Percentage = 24.8%

**Answer:** 24.8%

### Part (b) [3 marks]
Find least weight for large eggs.

**Solution:**

Small: 24.8%, Medium: 40%, Large: 100% - 24.8% - 40% = 35.2%

For large eggs, we need the 64.8th percentile (24.8% + 40% = 64.8%)
P(Z < z) = 0.648, but we want P(Z > z) = 0.352
So P(Z < z) = 1 - 0.352 = 0.648

Actually, let me recalculate: If 40% are medium, and we know the boundary between small and medium, we need the boundary between medium and large.

P(X > w) = 0.352 (since 35.2% are large)
P(Z > (w - 80.5)/6.6) = 0.352
P(Z < (w - 80.5)/6.6) = 0.648

From tables: Φ(0.378) = 0.648
(w - 80.5)/6.6 = 0.378
w = 80.5 + 0.378 × 6.6 = 80.5 + 2.495 = 83.0

**Answer:** 83.0 grams

### Part (c) [5 marks]
150 eggs weighed. Find P(more than 68 classified as medium) using approximation.

**Solution:**

Let Y ~ B(150, 0.4)
For normal approximation:
μ = np = 150 × 0.4 = 60
σ² = np(1-p) = 150 × 0.4 × 0.6 = 36
σ = 6

Using continuity correction: P(Y > 68) = P(Y ≥ 68.5)
Z = (68.5 - 60)/6 = 8.5/6 = 1.417

P(Y > 68) = P(Z > 1.417) = 1 - Φ(1.417) = 1 - 0.9217 = 0.0783

**Answer:** 0.0783

## Question 4 [9 marks]
**Topic: Histograms and Descriptive Statistics**

150 athletes' times:

| Time (minutes) | 101-120 | 121-130 | 131-135 | 136-145 | 146-160 |
|----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Frequency      | 18      | 48      | 34      | 32      | 18      |

### Part (a) [4 marks]
Draw histogram.

**Solution:**

Calculate frequency densities:
- Class widths: 20, 10, 5, 10, 15
- Frequency densities: 18/20=0.9, 48/10=4.8, 34/5=6.8, 32/10=3.2, 18/15=1.2

**Histogram:** Draw bars with heights 0.9, 4.8, 6.8, 3.2, 1.2 respectively
- x-axis: Time (minutes) from 100 to 160
- y-axis: Frequency density
- Bar boundaries: 100.5, 120.5, 130.5, 135.5, 145.5, 160.5

### Part (b) [5 marks]
Calculate mean and standard deviation.

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** Find midpoints
110.5, 125.5, 133, 140.5, 153

**Step 2:** Calculate mean
Mean = (18×110.5 + 48×125.5 + 34×133 + 32×140.5 + 18×153)/150
= (1989 + 6024 + 4522 + 4496 + 2754)/150
= 19785/150 = 131.9

**Step 3:** Calculate variance
Variance = Σ(f×x²)/n - (mean)²
= (18×110.5² + 48×125.5² + 34×133² + 32×140.5² + 18×153²)/150 - (131.9)²
= (219769.5 + 756552 + 601462 + 632320 + 421578)/150 - 17397.61
= 2631681.5/150 - 17397.61
= 17544.54 - 17397.61 = 146.93

Standard deviation = √146.93 = 12.1

Wait, let me recalculate more carefully:
Σ(f×x²) = 18×(110.5)² + 48×(125.5)² + 34×(133)² + 32×(140.5)² + 18×(153)²
= 18×12210.25 + 48×15750.25 + 34×17689 + 32×19740.25 + 18×23409
= 219784.5 + 756012 + 601426 + 631688 + 421362 = 2630272.5

Variance = 2630272.5/150 - (131.9)² = 17535.15 - 17397.61 = 137.54
Standard deviation = √137.54 = 11.7

**Answer:** Mean = 131.9 minutes, Standard deviation = 11.7 minutes

## Question 5 [9 marks]
**Topic: Probability Distributions and Conditional Probability**

Red spinner: P(X=1)=0.28, P(X=2)=p, P(X=3)=2p, P(X=4)=3p
Blue and green spinners: fair (each outcome = 0.25)

### Part (a) [1 mark]
Show that p = 0.12.

**Solution:**

Sum of probabilities = 1:
0.28 + p + 2p + 3p = 1
0.28 + 6p = 1
6p = 0.72
p = 0.12 ✓

### Part (b) [3 marks]
Find P(sum of three scores ≤ 4).

**Solution:**

Possible combinations for sum ≤ 4:
- (1,1,1): P = 0.28 × 0.25 × 0.25 = 0.0175
- (1,1,2): P = 0.28 × 0.25 × 0.25 = 0.0175  
- (1,2,1): P = 0.28 × 0.25 × 0.25 = 0.0175
- (2,1,1): P = 0.12 × 0.25 × 0.25 = 0.0075

Total = 0.0175 + 0.0175 + 0.0175 + 0.0075 = 0.06

**Answer:** 0.06

### Part (c) [5 marks]
Find P(product ≤ 4 | X is odd).

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** P(X is odd) = P(X=1) + P(X=3) = 0.28 + 0.24 = 0.52

**Step 2:** Find scenarios where product ≤ 4 AND X is odd:

When X = 1: product = 1×B×G ≤ 4 always true
- All 16 combinations work: P = 0.28 × 1 = 0.28

When X = 3: product = 3×B×G ≤ 4, so B×G ≤ 4/3 ≈ 1.33
- Only (B,G) = (1,1) works: P = 0.24 × 0.25 × 0.25 = 0.015

**Step 3:** P(product ≤ 4 AND X odd) = 0.28 × 0.25² × 8 + 0.24 × 0.25² × 1
= 0.28 × 0.0625 × 8 + 0.24 × 0.0625
= 0.14 + 0.015 = 0.155

**Step 4:** P(product ≤ 4 | X odd) = 0.155/0.52 = 31/104 ≈ 0.298

**Answer:** 0.298

## Question 6 [10 marks]
**Topic: Arrangements and Combinations**

8 friends, 2 tables (X and Y), each seats 4. Rajid, Sue, Tan are three friends.

### Part (a) [3 marks]
Rajid and Sue same table, Tan at other table. Find ways to divide into groups.

**Solution:**

**Case 1:** Rajid and Sue at table X, Tan at table Y
- Choose 2 more for table X from remaining 5: C(5,2) = 10 ways
- Remaining 3 go to table Y with Tan

**Case 2:** Rajid and Sue at table Y, Tan at table X  
- Choose 2 more for table Y from remaining 5: C(5,2) = 10 ways
- Remaining 3 go to table X with Tan

Total = 10 + 10 = 20 ways

**Answer:** 20

### Part (b) [3 marks]
Rajid and Sue at table X on same side. Find total seating arrangements.

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** Choose 2 others for table X: C(6,2) = 15 ways
**Step 2:** Arrange 4 people at table X with Rajid and Sue on same side:
- Choose which side for Rajid and Sue: 2 ways
- Arrange Rajid and Sue on chosen side: 2! = 2 ways  
- Arrange other 2 on opposite side: 2! = 2 ways
- Total for table X: 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 ways

**Step 3:** Arrange 4 people at table Y: 4! = 24 ways

Total = 15 × 8 × 24 = 2880

**Answer:** 2880

### Part (c) [4 marks]
Line for photo: Rajid and Sue together, neither at end.

**Solution:**

**Method:** Total with RS together - arrangements with RS together at ends

**Step 1:** Arrangements with RS together
Treat RS as one unit: 7 units to arrange = 7!
RS can be arranged internally: 2! ways
Total with RS together = 7! × 2! = 10080

**Step 2:** Arrangements with RS together at ends
RS at left end: 6! × 2! = 1440
RS at right end: 6! × 2! = 1440
Total at ends = 2880

**Step 3:** Required arrangements
RS together but not at ends = 10080 - 2880 = 7200

**Answer:** 7200
