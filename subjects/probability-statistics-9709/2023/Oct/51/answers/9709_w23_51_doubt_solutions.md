## Question 3: Normal Distribution - Egg Classification

**Context**: Egg weights follow normal distribution N(80.5, 6.6²). Classification: Small < 76g, 40% are medium.

### Part (a): Percentage of eggs classified as small

**Problem**: Find the percentage of eggs that are classified as small (weight < 76g).

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Apply standardization formula
P(X < 76) = P(Z < (76 - 80.5)/6.6) = P(Z < -0.6818)

**Step 2**: Use standard normal table
P(Z < -0.6818) = 1 - Φ(0.6818) = 1 - 0.7524 = 0.2476

**Step 3**: Convert to percentage
0.2476 × 100% = **24.8%**

### Part (b): Least possible weight of a large egg

**Problem**: Find the minimum weight for an egg to be classified as large, given 40% are medium.

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Determine the distribution of classifications
- Small: < 76g → 24.8% (from part a)
- Medium: 40% (given)
- Large: 100% - 24.8% - 40% = 35.2%

**Step 2**: Find the boundary between medium and large
Since 35.2% are large, 64.8% are small or medium.
We need P(X > w) = 0.352, so P(X ≤ w) = 0.648

**Step 3**: Find corresponding z-value
P(Z ≤ z) = 0.648
From tables: z = 0.378

**Step 4**: Convert back to x-value
(w - 80.5)/6.6 = 0.378
w - 80.5 = 0.378 × 6.6 = 2.495
w = 80.5 + 2.495 = **83.0g**

### Part (c): Probability that more than 68 out of 150 eggs are medium

**Problem**: Use normal approximation to find P(X > 68) where X ~ B(150, 0.4).

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Set up binomial parameters
n = 150, p = 0.4 (probability of medium)
Mean μ = np = 150 × 0.4 = 60
Variance σ² = np(1-p) = 150 × 0.4 × 0.6 = 36
Standard deviation σ = 6

**Step 2**: Apply continuity correction and standardize
P(X > 68) = P(X ≥ 69) ≈ P(Y > 68.5) where Y ~ N(60, 36)

P(Y > 68.5) = P(Z > (68.5 - 60)/6) = P(Z > 1.417)

**Step 3**: Calculate probability
P(Z > 1.417) = 1 - Φ(1.417) = 1 - 0.9217 = **0.0783**

## Question 6: Seating Arrangements

**Context**: 8 friends with two rectangular tables seating 4 each. Rajid, Sue, and Tan are specified friends.

### Part (a): Groups with constraints

**Problem**: Divide 8 friends into two groups of 4. Rajid and Sue must be at the same table, Tan must be at the other table.

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Fix Rajid and Sue together, Tan separate
- Rajid and Sue go to one table (say Table X)
- Tan goes to the other table (Table Y)
- Need to choose 2 more for Table X from remaining 5 friends
- Remaining 3 automatically go to Table Y with Tan

**Step 2**: Calculate combinations
Ways to choose 2 from 5 remaining friends = C(5,2) = 10

**Step 3**: Account for table labeling
Since tables are distinguishable (X and Y), we multiply by 2:
10 × 2 = **20**

### Part (b): Seating arrangements with specific constraints

**Problem**: Rajid and Sue sit at Table X on the same side, Tan can sit anywhere. Find total seating arrangements.

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Choose 2 friends to join Rajid and Sue at Table X
From remaining 5 friends: C(5,2) = 15 ways

**Step 2**: Arrange people at Table X
- Rajid and Sue on same side: 2 ways to arrange them
- Other 2 people: 2! ways to arrange them on the other side
- Choice of which side Rajid-Sue pair sits: 2 ways
Total at Table X: 2 × 2! × 2 = 8 ways

**Step 3**: Arrange people at Table Y
Remaining 4 friends can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways

**Step 4**: Apply multiplication principle
Total arrangements = 15 × 8 × 24 = **2880**

### Part (c): Line arrangement with constraints

**Problem**: 8 friends in a line. Rajid and Sue next to each other, but neither at an end.

**Solution**:

**Method 1**: Total with RS together - arrangements with RS at ends

**Step 1**: Arrangements with Rajid and Sue together
Treat RS as one unit: 7 units to arrange = 7! ways
RS can be arranged within their unit: 2 ways
Total with RS together: 7! × 2 = 10,080

**Step 2**: Arrangements with RS together AND at an end
- RS unit at left end: 6! arrangements of remaining people × 2 arrangements within RS = 6! × 2 = 1,440
- RS unit at right end: 6! × 2 = 1,440
Total with RS at ends: 1,440 + 1,440 = 2,880

**Step 3**: Apply subtraction principle
Required arrangements = 10,080 - 2,880 = **7,200**

**Method 2**: Direct positioning approach

**Step 1**: Choose positions for RS unit (not at ends)
Available positions for RS unit: positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (5 positions)

**Step 2**: Arrange remaining 6 friends
6! = 720 ways

**Step 3**: Arrange RS within their unit
2 ways

**Step 4**: Calculate total
5 × 720 × 2 = **7,200**
