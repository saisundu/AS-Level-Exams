## Question 3: Binomial Distribution with Normal Approximation

**Context**: Factory produces electrical components with 15% being faulty. Random sample of 200 components is chosen.

### Problem: Use normal approximation to find P(more than 40 components are faulty)

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Set up binomial distribution parameters
Let X = number of faulty components
X ~ B(200, 0.15)

**Step 2**: Calculate mean and variance for normal approximation
Mean μ = np = 200 × 0.15 = 30
Variance σ² = np(1-p) = 200 × 0.15 × 0.85 = 25.5
Standard deviation σ = √25.5 = 5.05

**Step 3**: Apply continuity correction and standardize
We want P(X > 40), which with continuity correction becomes P(X > 40.5)

Using normal approximation: P(X > 40.5) = P(Z > (40.5 - 30)/5.05)
= P(Z > 10.5/5.05) = P(Z > 2.079)

**Step 4**: Calculate probability using standard normal distribution
P(Z > 2.079) = 1 - Φ(2.079) = 1 - 0.9812 = **0.0188**

## Question 5: Normal Distribution Applications

**Context**: Multiple parts involving normal distributions with different parameters.

### Part (a)(i): Standard normal distribution application

**Problem**: Heights are normally distributed with mean 166cm and standard deviation 10cm. Find P(height < 170cm).

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Standardize the value
P(X < 170) = P(Z < (170 - 166)/10) = P(Z < 4/10) = P(Z < 0.4)

**Step 2**: Use standard normal table
P(Z < 0.4) = Φ(0.4) = **0.655**

### Part (a)(ii): Inverse normal distribution

**Problem**: Given that 40% of members have heights greater than h cm, find h to 2 decimal places.

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Set up the probability statement
P(X > h) = 0.40
Therefore: P(X ≤ h) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60

**Step 2**: Find corresponding z-value
P(Z ≤ z) = 0.60
From standard normal tables: z = 0.253

**Step 3**: Convert back to x-value using standardization formula
(h - 166)/10 = 0.253
h - 166 = 0.253 × 10 = 2.53
h = 166 + 2.53 = **168.53 cm**

### Part (b): Normal distribution with parameter relationship

**Problem**: Random variable X ~ N(μ, σ²) where σ = (2/3)μ. Find P(X > 0).

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Express standard deviation in terms of μ
Given: σ = (2/3)μ

**Step 2**: Standardize X = 0
P(X > 0) = P(Z > (0 - μ)/σ) = P(Z > (0 - μ)/(2μ/3)) = P(Z > -3μ/(2μ)) = P(Z > -3/2) = P(Z > -1.5)

**Step 3**: Calculate probability
P(Z > -1.5) = 1 - P(Z ≤ -1.5) = 1 - Φ(-1.5) = 1 - (1 - Φ(1.5)) = Φ(1.5)

From standard normal tables: Φ(1.5) = **0.933**
