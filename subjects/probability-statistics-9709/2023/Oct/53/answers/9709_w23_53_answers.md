### Question 1: Discrete Probability Distribution [6 marks]

Becky works at home X days per week, where P(X = x) = kx(x + 1) for x = 1, 2, 3, 4.

**(a) Draw up the probability distribution table for X, giving the probabilities as numerical fractions [3 marks]**

For each value of x:
- P(X = 1) = k(1)(1 + 1) = k(1)(2) = 2k
- P(X = 2) = k(2)(2 + 1) = k(2)(3) = 6k
- P(X = 3) = k(3)(3 + 1) = k(3)(4) = 12k
- P(X = 4) = k(4)(4 + 1) = k(4)(5) = 20k

Since probabilities must sum to 1:
2k + 6k + 12k + 20k = 1
40k = 1
k = 1/40

| x | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P(X = x) | 2/40 = 1/20 | 6/40 = 3/20 | 12/40 = 3/10 | 20/40 = 1/2 |

**(b) Find E(X) and Var(X) [3 marks]**

E(X) = 1(1/20) + 2(3/20) + 3(3/10) + 4(1/2)
E(X) = 1/20 + 6/20 + 18/20 + 40/20
E(X) = 65/20 = 13/4 = 3.25

E(X²) = 1²(1/20) + 2²(3/20) + 3²(3/10) + 4²(1/2)
E(X²) = 1/20 + 12/20 + 54/20 + 160/20
E(X²) = 227/20 = 11.35

Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]²
Var(X) = 227/20 - (13/4)²
Var(X) = 227/20 - 169/16
Var(X) = (227×4 - 169×5)/(20×4)
Var(X) = (908 - 845)/80
Var(X) = 63/80

### Question 2: Normal Distribution Applications [6 marks]

**(a) Find the probability that a randomly chosen large bag weighs between 1.42kg and 1.52kg [3 marks]**

Large bags: X ~ N(1.5, 0.05²)

Standardize: Z = (X - 1.5)/0.05

P(1.42 < X < 1.52) = P((1.42-1.5)/0.05 < Z < (1.52-1.5)/0.05)
P(1.42 < X < 1.52) = P(-1.6 < Z < 0.4)
P(1.42 < X < 1.52) = Φ(0.4) - Φ(-1.6)
P(1.42 < X < 1.52) = Φ(0.4) - [1 - Φ(1.6)]
P(1.42 < X < 1.52) = 0.6554 - (1 - 0.9452)
P(1.42 < X < 1.52) = 0.6554 - 0.0548 = 0.601

**(b) Find the value of σ [3 marks]**

Small bags: Y ~ N(0.75, σ²)
Given: P(Y < 0.9) = 0.68

Standardize: P((0.9 - 0.75)/σ < Z) = 0.68
P(0.15/σ < Z) = 0.68

From normal tables: Φ(0.468) = 0.68
Therefore: 0.15/σ = 0.468
σ = 0.15/0.468 = 0.321

### Question 3: Conditional Probability with Bags [7 marks]

Tim has two bags:
- Bag A: 8 white, 4 red, 3 yellow (15 total)
- Bag B: 6 white, 7 red, 2 yellow (15 total)

Dice roll: 1 or 2 → Bag A (P = 2/6 = 1/3), 3-6 → Bag B (P = 4/6 = 2/3)

**(a) Find the probability that both marbles are white [3 marks]**

P(2 white from A) = P(A) × P(2W|A) = (1/3) × (8/15) × (7/14) = (1/3) × (56/210) = 56/630

P(2 white from B) = P(B) × P(2W|B) = (2/3) × (6/15) × (5/14) = (2/3) × (30/210) = 60/630

P(both white) = 56/630 + 60/630 = 116/630 = 58/315

**(b) Find the probability that the two marbles come from bag B given that one is white and one is red [4 marks]**

P(1W, 1R from A) = P(A) × P(1W,1R|A) = (1/3) × 2 × (8/15) × (4/14) = (1/3) × (64/210) = 64/630

P(1W, 1R from B) = P(B) × P(1W,1R|B) = (2/3) × 2 × (6/15) × (7/14) = (2/3) × (84/210) = 168/630

P(1W, 1R) = 64/630 + 168/630 = 232/630

P(from B | 1W, 1R) = P(1W,1R from B)/P(1W,1R) = (168/630)/(232/630) = 168/232 = 21/29

### Question 4: Data Representation and Analysis [10 marks]

Weight data for 120 students:

| Weight (x kg) | x ≤ 40 | x ≤ 60 | x ≤ 65 | x ≤ 70 | x ≤ 85 | x ≤ 100 |
|---------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Cumulative frequency | 0 | 14 | 38 | 60 | 106 | 120 |

**(a) Draw a cumulative frequency graph [2 marks]**

Plot points: (40, 0), (60, 14), (65, 38), (70, 60), (85, 106), (100, 120)
Connect with smooth curve.

**(b) Estimate the value of W where 35% weigh more than W kg [2 marks]**

35% weigh more than W means 65% weigh less than W
65% of 120 = 78 students

From graph, when cumulative frequency = 78, W ≈ 72 kg

**(c) Calculate estimates for the mean and standard deviation [6 marks]**

First, find frequencies for each interval:
- 40 < x ≤ 60: 14 - 0 = 14 students
- 60 < x ≤ 65: 38 - 14 = 24 students  
- 65 < x ≤ 70: 60 - 38 = 22 students
- 70 < x ≤ 85: 106 - 60 = 46 students
- 85 < x ≤ 100: 120 - 106 = 14 students

Using midpoints:
Mean = [14(50) + 24(62.5) + 22(67.5) + 46(77.5) + 14(92.5)]/120
Mean = [700 + 1500 + 1485 + 3565 + 1295]/120
Mean = 8545/120 = 71.2 kg

For standard deviation:
E(X²) = [14(50²) + 24(62.5²) + 22(67.5²) + 46(77.5²) + 14(92.5²)]/120
E(X²) = [14(2500) + 24(3906.25) + 22(4556.25) + 46(6006.25) + 14(8556.25)]/120
E(X²) = [35000 + 93750 + 100237.5 + 276287.5 + 119787.5]/120
E(X²) = 625062.5/120 = 5208.85

Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]²
Var(X) = 5208.85 - (71.2)² = 5208.85 - 5069.44 = 139.41

Standard deviation = √139.41 = 11.8 kg

### Question 5: Geometric and Binomial Distributions [11 marks]

Probability of passing driving test = 0.3

**(a)(i) Find P(2 ≤ X ≤ 6) where X is number of attempts [2 marks]**

X ~ Geo(0.3)
P(X = k) = (0.7)^(k-1) × 0.3

P(2 ≤ X ≤ 6) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) + P(X = 6)
P(2 ≤ X ≤ 6) = 0.7×0.3 + 0.7²×0.3 + 0.7³×0.3 + 0.7⁴×0.3 + 0.7⁵×0.3
P(2 ≤ X ≤ 6) = 0.3(0.7 + 0.49 + 0.343 + 0.2401 + 0.16807)
P(2 ≤ X ≤ 6) = 0.3(1.74117) = 0.522

**(a)(ii) Find E(X) [1 mark]**

For geometric distribution: E(X) = 1/p = 1/0.3 = 10/3 = 3.33

**(b) Find the probability that at least three of five friends will pass tomorrow [3 marks]**

Let Y = number who pass out of 5
Y ~ B(5, 0.3)

P(Y ≥ 3) = P(Y = 3) + P(Y = 4) + P(Y = 5)
P(Y = 3) = C(5,3) × (0.3)³ × (0.7)² = 10 × 0.027 × 0.49 = 0.1323
P(Y = 4) = C(5,4) × (0.3)⁴ × (0.7)¹ = 5 × 0.0081 × 0.7 = 0.02835
P(Y = 5) = C(5,5) × (0.3)⁵ × (0.7)⁰ = 1 × 0.00243 × 1 = 0.00243

P(Y ≥ 3) = 0.1323 + 0.02835 + 0.00243 = 0.163

**(c) Use approximation to find probability that more than 20 of 75 will pass [5 marks]**

Let Z = number who pass out of 75
Z ~ B(75, 0.3)

μ = np = 75 × 0.3 = 22.5
σ² = np(1-p) = 75 × 0.3 × 0.7 = 15.75
σ = √15.75 = 3.969

Since n is large and np, n(1-p) > 5, use normal approximation:
Z ~ N(22.5, 15.75)

P(Z > 20) = P(Z ≥ 20.5) with continuity correction

Standardize: P(Z ≥ 20.5) = P((20.5 - 22.5)/3.969 ≤ W) = P(W ≥ -0.504)
P(Z > 20) = Φ(0.504) = 0.693

### Question 6: Combinatorics and Arrangements [10 marks]

12 people: Jai, Kaz, 5 friends, 5 wives

**(a)(i) Arrangements where each couple stands together [3 marks]**

Treat each couple as one unit: 6 units to arrange = 6!
Within each unit, 2 arrangements = 2⁶

Total arrangements = 6! × 2⁶ = 720 × 64 = 46,080

**(a)(ii) Jai and Kaz in middle, friends on one side, wives on other [2 marks]**

Jai and Kaz in positions 6,7: 2! ways
5 friends on one side: 5! ways  
5 wives on other side: 5! ways

Since the friends can be on either the left or right side of Jai and Kaz, there's an additional factor of 2.

Total arrangements = 2 × 2! × 5! × 5! = 2 × 2 × 120 × 120 = 57,600

**(b) Probability that Jai and Kaz are in same group [5 marks]**

Total ways to divide 12 people into groups of 5, 4, 3:
12!/(5! × 4! × 3!) = 27,720

Ways where Jai and Kaz are together:
- Both in group of 5: C(10,3) × 10!/(3! × 4! × 3!) = 120 × 4200 = 504,000
- Both in group of 4: C(10,2) × 10!/(5! × 2! × 3!) = 45 × 2520 = 113,400  
- Both in group of 3: C(10,1) × 10!/(5! × 4! × 1!) = 10 × 1260 = 12,600

Wait, let me recalculate this more systematically:

Total ways = C(12,5) × C(7,4) × C(3,3) = 792 × 35 × 1 = 27,720

Favorable ways:
- Both in group of 5: C(10,3) = 120
- Both in group of 4: C(10,2) = 45
- Both in group of 3: C(10,1) = 10

Total favorable = 120 + 45 + 10 = 175

Probability = 175/27,720 = 25/3,960 = 5/792
