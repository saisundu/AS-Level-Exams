## Question 1 [4 marks]
**Two sets of data: 20 values with Σ(x-30) = 439, Σ(x-30)² = 12405; 25 values with Σ(x-30) = 470, Σ(x-30)² = 11346.**

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Find the mean of all 45 values.**

### Solution:

For combined data sets, we use:
Mean = [Σ(x-30) + 30n]/n for all values

Total Σ(x-30) = 439 + 470 = 909
Total n = 20 + 25 = 45

Mean = (909 + 30×45)/45 = (909 + 1350)/45 = 2259/45 = 50.2

**Answer: 50.2**

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**Find the standard deviation of all 45 values.**

### Solution:

For combined variance:
Variance = [Σ(x-30)²]/n - [Σ(x-30)/n]²

Total Σ(x-30)² = 12405 + 11346 = 23751

Variance = 23751/45 - (909/45)²
= 527.8 - (20.2)²
= 527.8 - 408.04
= 119.76

Standard deviation = √119.76 = 10.9

**Answer: 10.9**

## Question 2 [7 marks]
**Raccoon tail lengths: N(28, 3.3²). Raccoon masses: N(8.5, σ²) with 75% > 7.6 kg.**

### Part (a) [4 marks]
**Find P(23 < tail length < 35).**

### Solution:

Let X ~ N(28, 3.3²)

Standardizing:
- Z₁ = (23 - 28)/3.3 = -5/3.3 = -1.515
- Z₂ = (35 - 28)/3.3 = 7/3.3 = 2.121

P(23 < X < 35) = P(-1.515 < Z < 2.121)
= Φ(2.121) - Φ(-1.515)
= Φ(2.121) - (1 - Φ(1.515))
= 0.9830 - (1 - 0.9351)
= 0.9830 - 0.0649 = 0.918

**Answer: 0.918**

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Find σ given 75% have mass > 7.6 kg.**

### Solution:

Let M ~ N(8.5, σ²)

P(M > 7.6) = 0.75, so P(M < 7.6) = 0.25

From normal tables: Φ(z) = 0.25 ⟹ z = -0.674

Standardizing: (7.6 - 8.5)/σ = -0.674
-0.9/σ = -0.674
σ = 0.9/0.674 = 1.34

**Answer: σ = 1.34**

## Question 3 [6 marks]
**Heights of 200 adults in grouped frequency table.**

### Part (a) [4 marks]
**Draw histogram.**

### Solution:

First, calculate frequency densities:

| Height (cm) | Frequency | Class Width | Frequency Density |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 130-150     | 16        | 20          | 0.8               |
| 150-160     | 32        | 10          | 3.2               |
| 160-170     | 76        | 10          | 7.6               |
| 170-175     | 64        | 5           | 12.8              |
| 175-195     | 12        | 20          | 0.6               |

**Histogram requirements:**
- Bars at correct heights (0.8, 3.2, 7.6, 12.8, 0.6)
- Bars with correct widths at boundaries 130, 150, 160, 170, 175, 195
- Axes labeled "Height (cm)" and "Frequency Density"
- Appropriate scale with at least 3 values marked

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**Show that interquartile range R ≤ 15.**

### Solution:

Total frequency = 200
- Q₁ position = 200/4 = 50th value
- Q₃ position = 3×200/4 = 150th value

**Finding Q₁:**
Cumulative frequencies: 16, 48, 124, 188, 200
50th value falls in 160-170 class (since 48 < 50 ≤ 124)
So Q₁ is in the 160-170 interval

**Finding Q₃:**
150th value falls in 160-170 class (since 124 < 150 ≤ 188)
So Q₃ is in the 170-175 interval

Maximum possible IQR = 175 - 160 = 15

Therefore, R ≤ 15 ✓

## Question 4 [6 marks]
**Game with 4-sided die, up to 3 throws per turn, score 1 point for getting a 4.**

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Show P(score in one turn) = 37/64.**

### Solution:

P(get 4) = 1/4, P(not 4) = 3/4

P(score in one turn) = P(4 on 1st) + P(4 on 2nd) + P(4 on 3rd)
= 1/4 + (3/4)(1/4) + (3/4)²(1/4)
= 1/4 + 3/16 + 9/64
= 16/64 + 12/64 + 9/64 = 37/64 ✓

### Part (b) [1 mark]
**Find P(neither player scores in first two turns).**

### Solution:

P(no score in one turn) = 1 - 37/64 = 27/64

P(neither scores in 2 turns each) = (27/64)⁴ = 531441/16777216 = 0.0317

**Answer: 0.0317**

### Part (c) [3 marks]
**Find P(Xeno scores 2 more than Yao in 3 turns each).**

### Solution:

For Xeno to score 2 more than Yao:
- Xeno 3, Yao 1: P = C(3,3)(37/64)³ × C(3,1)(37/64)(27/64)² = (37/64)³ × 3(37/64)(27/64)²
- Xeno 2, Yao 0: P = C(3,2)(37/64)²(27/64) × (27/64)³

P(Xeno 3, Yao 1) = (37/64)⁴ × 3 × (27/64)² = 3 × (37)⁴ × (27)²/(64)⁶
P(Xeno 2, Yao 0) = 3 × (37)² × (27)⁴/(64)⁶

Total probability = 3(37)⁴(27)²/(64)⁶ + 3(37)²(27)⁴/(64)⁶ = 0.0914

**Answer: 0.0914**

## Question 5 [10 marks]
**Arctic snow probability: P(snow on any day) = 0.7. White week = at least 5 days of snow in 7.**

### Part (a) [3 marks]
**Find P(white week).**

### Solution:

Let X = number of snow days in 7 days
X ~ B(7, 0.7)

P(white week) = P(X ≥ 5) = P(X = 5) + P(X = 6) + P(X = 7)

P(X = 5) = C(7,5)(0.7)⁵(0.3)² = 21 × 0.16807 × 0.09 = 0.31765
P(X = 6) = C(7,6)(0.7)⁶(0.3)¹ = 7 × 0.117649 × 0.3 = 0.24706
P(X = 7) = C(7,7)(0.7)⁷(0.3)⁰ = 1 × 0.0823543 × 1 = 0.08235

P(white week) = 0.31765 + 0.24706 + 0.08235 = 0.647

**Answer: 0.647**

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**Find P(at least 1 white week in 3 weeks).**

### Solution:

P(at least 1 white week) = 1 - P(no white weeks)
= 1 - (1 - 0.647)³ = 1 - (0.353)³ = 1 - 0.044 = 0.956

**Answer: 0.956**

### Part (c) [5 marks]
**P(white week) = 0.8. Find P(fewer than 47 white weeks in 60 weeks).**

### Solution:

Let Y = number of white weeks in 60 weeks
Y ~ B(60, 0.8)

Using normal approximation (since n large, np = 48 > 5, nq = 12 > 5):
Mean μ = np = 60 × 0.8 = 48
Variance σ² = npq = 60 × 0.8 × 0.2 = 9.6
Standard deviation σ = √9.6 = 3.098

P(Y < 47) = P(Y ≤ 46.5) using continuity correction

Standardizing: Z = (46.5 - 48)/3.098 = -1.5/3.098 = -0.484

P(Y < 47) = P(Z < -0.484) = 1 - Φ(0.484) = 1 - 0.686 = 0.314

**Answer: 0.314**

## Question 6 [7 marks]
**Three biased coins with P(H) = 1/3, 1/4, 1/5. Then five coins total with two additional coins having P(H) = p.**

### Part (a) [4 marks]
**Draw probability distribution table for X (heads from 3 coins).**

### Solution:

P(H₁) = 1/3, P(T₁) = 2/3
P(H₂) = 1/4, P(T₂) = 3/4  
P(H₃) = 1/5, P(T₃) = 4/5

**X = 0 (no heads):**
P(X = 0) = (2/3)(3/4)(4/5) = 24/60 = 2/5 = 0.4

**X = 1 (exactly one head):**
P(X = 1) = (1/3)(3/4)(4/5) + (2/3)(1/4)(4/5) + (2/3)(3/4)(1/5)
= 12/60 + 8/60 + 6/60 = 26/60 = 13/30 = 0.433

**X = 2 (exactly two heads):**
P(X = 2) = (1/3)(1/4)(4/5) + (1/3)(3/4)(1/5) + (2/3)(1/4)(1/5)
= 4/60 + 3/60 + 2/60 = 9/60 = 3/20 = 0.15

**X = 3 (all heads):**
P(X = 3) = (1/3)(1/4)(1/5) = 1/60 = 0.0167

### Probability Distribution Table:

| x | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P(X = x) | 2/5 | 13/30 | 3/20 | 1/60 |
| | 0.4 | 0.433 | 0.15 | 0.0167 |

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Given P(Y = 0) = 6P(Y = 5) for 5 coins, find p.**

### Solution:

For 5 coins (original 3 plus 2 with probability p):

P(Y = 0) = P(all tails) = (2/3)(3/4)(4/5)(1-p)² = (24/60)(1-p)² = (2/5)(1-p)²

P(Y = 5) = P(all heads) = (1/3)(1/4)(1/5)p² = (1/60)p²

Given: P(Y = 0) = 6P(Y = 5)
(2/5)(1-p)² = 6(1/60)p²
(2/5)(1-p)² = (1/10)p²
4(1-p)² = p²
4(1-2p+p²) = p²
4-8p+4p² = p²
3p²-8p+4 = 0

Using quadratic formula: p = (8 ± √(64-48))/6 = (8 ± 4)/6

p = 2 or p = 2/3

Since p must be a probability (0 ≤ p ≤ 1), we have p = 2/3.

**Answer: p = 2/3**

## Question 7 [10 marks]
**Arrangements of digits 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5.**

### Part (a) [1 mark]
**Total arrangements of 8 digits.**

### Solution:

With repeated digits: 2 appears twice, 4 appears three times
Total arrangements = 8!/(2!×3!) = 40320/(2×6) = 3360

**Answer: 3360**

### Part (b) [4 marks]
**Arrangements with 2 at start and end, three 4s not all together.**

### Solution:

Pattern: 2 _ _ _ _ _ _ 2

Remaining digits: 1, 3, 4, 4, 4 (6 positions for 5 digits)

**Total arrangements with 2s at ends:**
Arrange 1, 3, 4, 4, 4 in 6 positions = 6!/3! = 720/6 = 120

**Arrangements with 2s at ends AND three 4s together:**
Treat 444 as one unit: 2 (444) _ _ _ 2
Arrange 1, 3, (444) in 4 positions = 4! = 24

**Answer:** 120 - 24 = 96

### Part (c) [5 marks]
**Probability that 3 randomly selected digits are all different.**

### Solution:

**Total ways to select 3 digits from 8:** C(8,3) = 56

**Ways to select 3 different digits:**
Available distinct digits: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

We need to count selections where all 3 chosen digits are different:

**Case analysis by digits chosen:**
- {1,2,3}: C(1,1)×C(2,1)×C(1,1) = 1×2×1 = 2
- {1,2,4}: C(1,1)×C(2,1)×C(3,1) = 1×2×3 = 6  
- {1,2,5}: C(1,1)×C(2,1)×C(1,1) = 1×2×1 = 2
- {1,3,4}: C(1,1)×C(1,1)×C(3,1) = 1×1×3 = 3
- {1,3,5}: C(1,1)×C(1,1)×C(1,1) = 1×1×1 = 1
- {1,4,5}: C(1,1)×C(3,1)×C(1,1) = 1×3×1 = 3
- {2,3,4}: C(2,1)×C(1,1)×C(3,1) = 2×1×3 = 6
- {2,3,5}: C(2,1)×C(1,1)×C(1,1) = 2×1×1 = 2
- {2,4,5}: C(2,1)×C(3,1)×C(1,1) = 2×3×1 = 6
- {3,4,5}: C(1,1)×C(3,1)×C(1,1) = 1×3×1 = 3

Total favorable outcomes = 2+6+2+3+1+3+6+2+6+3 = 34

Probability = 34/56 = 17/28 = 0.607

**Answer: 17/28 = 0.607**
