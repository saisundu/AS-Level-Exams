## Question 5: Crossword Puzzle Probability

### Part (a): First success on 5th day

**Problem**: Salah attempts crossword puzzles daily with success probability 0.65. Find the probability he completes it for the first time on the 5th day.

**Solution**:
This is a geometric distribution where the first success occurs on the 5th trial.

P(first success on 5th day) = (0.35)⁴ × 0.65

**Step-by-step calculation**:
= (0.35)⁴ × 0.65
= 0.01500625 × 0.65
= **0.00975**

### Part (b): Second success on 5th day

**Problem**: Find the probability that Salah completes the puzzle for the second time on the 5th day.

**Solution**:
For the second success to occur on day 5:
- Exactly one success must occur in the first 4 days
- Day 5 must be a success

This follows a negative binomial distribution.

P(2nd success on 5th day) = C(4,1) × (0.65)¹ × (0.35)³ × 0.65

**Step-by-step calculation**:
= 4 × 0.65 × (0.35)³ × 0.65
= 4 × 0.65² × (0.35)³
= 4 × 0.4225 × 0.042875
= **0.0725**

### Part (c): Fewer than 5 successes in 7 days

**Problem**: Find the probability that Salah completes fewer than 5 puzzles in a week (7 days).

**Solution**:
This is a binomial distribution: X ~ B(7, 0.65)
We need P(X < 5) = P(X ≤ 4) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)

**Method 1**: Direct calculation
P(X ≤ 4) = Σ[k=0 to 4] C(7,k) × (0.65)ᵏ × (0.35)⁷⁻ᵏ

**Calculating each term**:
- P(X = 0) = C(7,0) × (0.35)⁷ = 0.00064
- P(X = 1) = C(7,1) × 0.65 × (0.35)⁶ = 0.00836  
- P(X = 2) = C(7,2) × (0.65)² × (0.35)⁵ = 0.04660
- P(X = 3) = C(7,3) × (0.65)³ × (0.35)⁴ = 0.14424
- P(X = 4) = C(7,4) × (0.65)⁴ × (0.35)³ = 0.26787

**Total**: P(X ≤ 4) = 0.00064 + 0.00836 + 0.04660 + 0.14424 + 0.26787 = **0.468**

**Method 2**: Using complement
P(X < 5) = 1 - P(X ≥ 5) = 1 - [P(X = 5) + P(X = 6) + P(X = 7)]
= 1 - [0.29848 + 0.18478 + 0.049022]
= 1 - 0.53228 = **0.468**

### Part (d): More than 50 successes in 84 days

**Problem**: Use a suitable approximation to find P(X > 50) where X is the number of successes in 84 days.

**Solution**:
X ~ B(84, 0.65). Since n is large, we use normal approximation.

**Step 1**: Check conditions for normal approximation
- n = 84, p = 0.65
- np = 84 × 0.65 = 54.6 > 5 ✓
- n(1-p) = 84 × 0.35 = 29.4 > 5 ✓

Normal approximation is valid.

**Step 2**: Calculate parameters
- Mean μ = np = 54.6
- Variance σ² = np(1-p) = 84 × 0.65 × 0.35 = 19.11
- Standard deviation σ = √19.11 = 4.371

**Step 3**: Apply continuity correction and standardize
P(X > 50) = P(X ≥ 50.5) using continuity correction

P(X > 50) = P(Z > (50.5 - 54.6)/4.371)
= P(Z > -0.9379)
= P(Z < 0.9379)
= Φ(0.9379)
= **0.826**

## Question 6: RECORDERS Arrangements

### Part (a): Total arrangements

**Problem**: How many different arrangements are there of the 9 letters in RECORDERS?

**Analysis**: RECORDERS has 9 letters: R-E-C-O-R-D-E-R-S (3 Rs, 2 Es, 4 others)

**Solution**:
Number of arrangements = 9!/(3! × 2!) = 362880/(6 × 2) = **30240**

### Part (b): E at each end, Rs not all together

**Problem**: Arrangements with E at beginning and end, and the three Rs not all together.

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Fix Es at the ends: E _ _ _ _ _ _ _ E
We need to arrange 7 middle letters: R, C, O, R, D, R (3 Rs, 4 others)

**Step 2**: Calculate total arrangements of middle 7 letters
Total = 7!/3! = 5040/6 = 840

**Step 3**: Subtract arrangements where all 3 Rs are together
Treat RRR as one unit: (RRR), C, O, D = 4 objects with no repeated letters
Arrangements with Rs together = 5!/1! = 120

**Step 4**: Final answer
Arrangements with Rs not all together = 840 - 120 = **720**

**Alternative Method**: Direct counting
- Rs not all together = (no Rs together) + (exactly 2 Rs together)
- No Rs together: Choose 3 positions from 7 for Rs such that no two are adjacent = C(5,3) × 4! = 10 × 24 = 240
- Exactly 2 Rs together: C(4,1) ways to place the pair, remaining R in C(5,1) ways = 4 × 5 × 4! = 480
- Total = 240 + 480 = **720**

### Part (c): Three Rs in same group

**Problem**: Letters divided randomly into groups of 5 and 4. Find probability that the three Rs are in the same group.

**Analysis**: RECORDERS: R(3), E(2), C(1), O(1), D(1), S(1)

**Solution**:

**Method 1**: Case analysis

**Case 1**: All 3 Rs in group of 5
- Ways to choose 2 more letters from remaining 6 for group of 5: C(6,2) = 15

**Case 2**: All 3 Rs in group of 4  
- Ways to choose 1 more letter from remaining 6 for group of 4: C(6,1) = 6

**Total favorable outcomes** = 15 + 6 = 21
**Total possible ways** to divide 9 letters into groups of 5 and 4 = C(9,5) = 126

**Probability** = 21/126 = 1/6 = **0.167**

**Method 2**: Probability approach
P(3 Rs in group of 5) = (5×4×3×2×1)/(9×8×7×6×5) × C(6,2)/C(6,2) = C(6,2)/C(9,5) = 15/126

P(3 Rs in group of 4) = (4×3×2×1)/(9×8×7×6) × C(6,1)/C(6,1) = C(6,1)/C(9,4) = 6/126

**Total probability** = 15/126 + 6/126 = 21/126 = **1/6**
