## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action Required:** Correct Questions 4, 5, and 7 to achieve full marks
2. **Data Reading Skills:** Improve stem-and-leaf diagram interpretation
3. **Probability Tables:** Ensure all possible outcomes are included
4. **Combinatorics Verification:** Cross-check complex arrangements against mark scheme methods

**Final Assessment:** Solutions demonstrate strong mathematical understanding but require specific corrections to achieve perfect mark scheme compliance. The errors are primarily computational and methodological rather than conceptual.
