## Question 1 (5 marks)

### Part (a) - Geometric Distribution [1 mark]

**Solution:**
Rajesh is successful for the first time on his 7th attempt means he fails 6 times then succeeds.

P(success) = 0.3, P(failure) = 0.7

P(first success on 7th attempt) = (0.7)⁶ × 0.3 = 0.117649 × 0.3 = 0.0353

**Answer:** 0.0353

**Marks awarded:** 1 mark

### Part (b) - Geometric Distribution [2 marks]

**Solution:**
"Successful for the first time before his 6th attempt" means successful on attempt 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

P(first success before 6th attempt) = 1 - P(first success on 6th attempt or later)
= 1 - P(fails first 5 attempts)
= 1 - (0.7)⁵
= 1 - 0.16807
= 0.832

**Answer:** 0.832

**Marks awarded:** 2 marks

### Part (c) - Negative Binomial Distribution [2 marks]

**Solution:**
"Successful for the second time on his 10th attempt" means exactly 1 success in first 9 attempts, then success on 10th.

P(exactly 1 success in 9 attempts) × P(success on 10th)
= C(9,1) × (0.3)¹ × (0.7)⁸ × 0.3
= 9 × 0.3 × 0.05764801 × 0.3
= 0.0467

**Answer:** 0.0467

## Question 2 (5 marks)

### Part (a) - Conditional Probability [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Bag contains: 4 red, 5 blue (total 9 marbles)

**Case 1: Head (probability 1/3)**
Selects 1 marble
P(at least 1 red | head) = P(1 red) = 4/9

**Case 2: Tail (probability 2/3)**
Selects 2 marbles without replacement
P(at least 1 red | tail) = 1 - P(no red) = 1 - P(2 blue)
= 1 - (5/9) × (4/8) = 1 - 20/72 = 1 - 5/18 = 13/18

**Total probability:**
P(at least 1 red) = (1/3) × (4/9) + (2/3) × (13/18)
= 4/27 + 26/54 = 4/27 + 13/27 = 17/27

**Answer:** 17/27 = 0.630

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

### Part (b) - Bayes' Theorem [2 marks]

**Solution:**
P(no red marbles):
- If head: P(no red | head) = 5/9
- If tail: P(no red | tail) = 5/18

P(no red) = (1/3) × (5/9) + (2/3) × (5/18) = 5/27 + 10/54 = 5/27 + 5/27 = 10/27

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(head | no red) = P(no red | head) × P(head) / P(no red)
= (5/9) × (1/3) / (10/27) = (5/27) / (10/27) = 1/2

**Answer:** 1/2 = 0.5

## Question 3 (6 marks)

### Part (a) - Normal Distribution [3 marks]

**Given:** X ~ N(131, 54²), Large oranges ≥ 184g

**Solution:**
P(X ≥ 184) = P(Z ≥ (184-131)/54) = P(Z ≥ 53/54) = P(Z ≥ 0.981)

From normal tables: P(Z ≥ 0.981) = 1 - Φ(0.981) = 1 - 0.8365 = 0.1635

Percentage = 16.35% ≈ 16.4%

**Answer:** 16.4%

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

### Part (b) - Normal Distribution [3 marks]

**Given:** 20% of oranges are small

**Solution:**
Let maximum weight of small orange = w

P(X ≤ w) = 0.20
P(Z ≤ (w-131)/54) = 0.20

From normal tables: Φ⁻¹(0.20) = -0.842

(w-131)/54 = -0.842
w - 131 = -45.468
w = 131 - 45.468 = 85.5

**Answer:** 85.5 grams

## Question 4 (7 marks)

### Part (a) - Quartiles from Stem-and-Leaf [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Petral salaries in order (in $1000s):
26, 30, 30, 31, 32, 32, 32, 33, 34, 35, 35, 37, 40, 41, 43, 45, 45, 55, 59

n = 19, so median position = (19+1)/2 = 10th value
**Median = $35,000**

Q₁ position = (19+1)/4 = 5th value = $32,000
Q₃ position = 3(19+1)/4 = 15th value = $43,000

**IQR = Q₃ - Q₁ = $43,000 - $32,000 = $11,000**

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

### Part (b) - Box-and-Whisker Plots [3 marks]

**Solution:**
**Petral:**
- Minimum: $26,000
- Q₁: $32,000  
- Median: $35,000
- Q₃: $43,000
- Maximum: $59,000

**Ravon:**
- Minimum: $30,000 (from stem-and-leaf)
- Q₁: $32,000 (given)
- Median: $33,800 (given)
- Q₃: $34,400 (given)
- Maximum: $39,000 (from stem-and-leaf)

[Box-and-whisker plots would be drawn showing both companies on same scale]

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

### Part (c) - Mean vs Median [1 mark]

**Solution:**
The median would be better for Petral because the data shows positive skew (higher values like $55,000 and $59,000 pull the mean upward), making the median more representative of the typical salary.

## Question 5 (7 marks)

### Part (a) - Show P(X = 7) = 0.2 [1 mark]

**Solution:**
Coins: one $5, two $2, two $1
Total ways to select 2 coins = C(5,2) = 10

Ways to get $7: Select $5 and one $2 = 2 ways (since there are 2 different $2 coins)

P(X = 7) = 2/10 = 1/5 = 0.2 ✓

**Marks awarded:** 1 mark

### Part (b) - Probability Distribution Table [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Possible outcomes:
- X = 3: Select two $1 coins = C(2,2) = 1 way → P(X = 3) = 1/10
- X = 4: Select one $2 and one $1 = 2 × 2 = 4 ways → P(X = 4) = 4/10
- X = 6: Select one $5 and one $1 = 1 × 2 = 2 ways → P(X = 6) = 2/10
- X = 7: Select one $5 and one $2 = 1 × 2 = 2 ways → P(X = 7) = 2/10
- X = 9: Select two $2 coins = C(2,2) = 1 way → P(X = 9) = 1/10

| X | 3 | 4 | 6 | 7 | 9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P(X=x) | 0.1 | 0.4 | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.1 |

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

### Part (c) - Variance [3 marks]

**Solution:**
E(X) = 3(0.1) + 4(0.4) + 6(0.2) + 7(0.2) + 9(0.1)
= 0.3 + 1.6 + 1.2 + 1.4 + 0.9 = 5.4

E(X²) = 9(0.1) + 16(0.4) + 36(0.2) + 49(0.2) + 81(0.1)
= 0.9 + 6.4 + 7.2 + 9.8 + 8.1 = 32.4

Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]²
= 32.4 - (5.4)² = 32.4 - 29.16 = 3.24

**Answer:** Var(X) = 3.24

## Question 6 (10 marks)

### Part (a) - Normal Approximation to Binomial [5 marks]

**Solution:**
X ~ B(110, 0.25)
Mean μ = np = 110 × 0.25 = 27.5
Variance σ² = np(1-p) = 110 × 0.25 × 0.75 = 20.625
Standard deviation σ = √20.625 = 4.541

Using normal approximation with continuity correction:
P(X < 22) = P(X ≤ 21.5)

Standardizing: Z = (21.5 - 27.5)/4.541 = -6/4.541 = -1.321

P(Z ≤ -1.321) = 1 - Φ(1.321) = 1 - 0.9066 = 0.0934

**Answer:** 0.0934

**Marks awarded:** 5 marks

### Part (b) - Binomial Distribution [3 marks]

**Solution:**
P(good or satisfactory) = 0.25 + 0.60 = 0.85
X ~ B(10, 0.85)

P(X < 8) = P(X ≤ 7) = 1 - P(X ≥ 8) = 1 - [P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10)]

P(X = 8) = C(10,8) × (0.85)⁸ × (0.15)² = 45 × 0.2725 × 0.0225 = 0.2759
P(X = 9) = C(10,9) × (0.85)⁹ × (0.15)¹ = 10 × 0.2316 × 0.15 = 0.3474
P(X = 10) = (0.85)¹⁰ = 0.1969

P(X < 8) = 1 - (0.2759 + 0.3474 + 0.1969) = 1 - 0.8202 = 0.180

**Answer:** 0.180

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

### Part (c) - Multinomial Distribution [2 marks]

**Solution:**
P(1 good, 1 satisfactory, 1 poor) = 3! × (0.25)¹ × (0.60)¹ × (0.15)¹
= 6 × 0.25 × 0.60 × 0.15 = 6 × 0.0225 = 0.135

**Answer:** 0.135

## Question 7 (10 marks)

### Part (a) - Basic Arrangements [1 mark]

**Solution:**
REGENERATE has: R(2), E(4), G(1), N(1), T(1), A(1)

Total arrangements = 10!/(2! × 4! × 1! × 1! × 1! × 1!) = 3,628,800/(2 × 24) = 75,600

**Answer:** 75,600

**Marks awarded:** 1 mark

### Part (b) - Constrained Arrangements [4 marks]

**Solution:**
Constraints: 4 Es together, 2 Rs with exactly 3 letters between them

**Step 1:** Treat EEEE as one unit
Letters to arrange: (EEEE), G, N, T, A, R, R = 7 units with 2 Rs

**Step 2:** Place Rs with 3 letters between them
Pattern: R _ _ _ R
In 7 positions, this can be done in 3 ways: positions (1,5), (2,6), (3,7)

**Step 3:** For each R placement, arrange remaining 5 units in 5 positions
Remaining units: (EEEE), G, N, T, A = 5! = 120 ways

Total arrangements = 3 × 120 = 360

**Answer:** 360

**Marks awarded:** 4 marks

### Part (c) - Alternating Pattern [5 marks]

**Solution:**
Consonants: G, N, R, R, T (5 letters, 2 Rs)
Vowels: A, E, E, E, E (5 letters, 4 Es)

**Pattern must be:** C-V-C-V-C-V-C-V-C-V or V-C-V-C-V-C-V-C-V-C

**Case 1: C-V-C-V-C-V-C-V-C-V**
- Arrange consonants in 5 positions: 5!/2! = 60 ways
- Arrange vowels in 5 positions: 5!/4! = 5 ways
- Total for this case: 60 × 5 = 300

**Case 2: V-C-V-C-V-C-V-C-V-C**
- Same calculation: 300 ways

**Total favorable arrangements:** 300 + 300 = 600

**Total possible arrangements:** 75,600 (from part a)

**Probability = 600/75,600 = 1/126**

**Answer:** 1/126 ≈ 0.00794
