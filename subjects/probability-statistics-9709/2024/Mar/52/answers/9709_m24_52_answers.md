## Question 1 [4 marks total]
**Bag with 9 blue, 3 red marbles. Blue replaced, red not replaced.**

### Part (a) [1 mark]
**Find P(both marbles are red)**

### Solution:
For both marbles to be red:
- First marble must be red: P = 3/12 = 1/4
- Second marble must be red (given first was red and not replaced): P = 2/11

P(both red) = (3/12) × (2/11) = 6/132 = 1/22

**Answer: 1/22**

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Find P(first marble blue | second marble red)**

### Solution:
Using conditional probability: P(B₁|R₂) = P(B₁ ∩ R₂)/P(R₂)

**Step 1: Find P(B₁ ∩ R₂)**
If first marble is blue (and replaced), second marble is red:
P(B₁ ∩ R₂) = (9/12) × (3/12) = 27/144 = 3/16

**Step 2: Find P(R₂)**
Second marble can be red in two ways:
- First red, second red: (3/12) × (2/11) = 6/132 = 1/22
- First blue, second red: (9/12) × (3/12) = 27/144 = 3/16

P(R₂) = 1/22 + 3/16 = 8/176 + 33/176 = 41/176

**Step 3: Calculate conditional probability**
P(B₁|R₂) = (3/16)/(41/176) = (3/16) × (176/41) = 528/656 = 33/41

**Answer: 33/41 or 0.805**

## Question 2 [8 marks total]
**Sam's goal scoring: P(goal) = 0.7 independently**

### Part (a) [3 marks]
**10 attempts: P(fewer than 8 goals)**

### Solution:
Let X = number of goals in 10 attempts, X ~ B(10, 0.7)

P(X < 8) = 1 - P(X ≥ 8) = 1 - [P(X=8) + P(X=9) + P(X=10)]

**Calculate individual probabilities:**
P(X=8) = ¹⁰C₈(0.7)⁸(0.3)² = 45 × (0.7)⁸ × (0.3)² = 0.2335
P(X=9) = ¹⁰C₉(0.7)⁹(0.3)¹ = 10 × (0.7)⁹ × (0.3)¹ = 0.1211
P(X=10) = ¹⁰C₁₀(0.7)¹⁰(0.3)⁰ = 1 × (0.7)¹⁰ × 1 = 0.0282

P(X < 8) = 1 - (0.2335 + 0.1211 + 0.0282) = 1 - 0.3828 = 0.617

**Answer: 0.617**

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**P(first success before 5th attempt)**

### Solution:
P(first success before 5th attempt) = P(success on 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th attempt)
= 1 - P(first 4 attempts all fail)
= 1 - (0.3)⁴
= 1 - 0.0081 = 0.9919

**Answer: 0.9919**

### Part (c) [3 marks]
**Wei: P(goal) = 0.6. P(3rd goal on 7th attempt)**

### Solution:
For 3rd goal on 7th attempt:
- First 6 attempts: exactly 2 goals
- 7th attempt: 1 goal

This follows negative binomial distribution:
P(3rd goal on 7th attempt) = ⁶C₂ × (0.6)² × (0.4)⁴ × 0.6
= 15 × (0.6)³ × (0.4)⁴
= 15 × 0.216 × 0.0256
= 0.0829

**Answer: 0.0829**

**Puzzle completion times for 150 students**

| Time (t minutes) | 0≤t<20 | 20≤t<30 | 30≤t<35 | 35≤t<40 | 40≤t<50 | 50≤t<70 |
|------------------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Frequency        | 8      | 23      | 35      | 52      | 20      | 12      |

### Part (a) [4 marks]
**Draw histogram**

### Solution:
**Step 1: Calculate class widths and frequency densities**

| Class     | Width | Frequency | Frequency Density |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| 0≤t<20    | 20    | 8         | 8/20 = 0.4       |
| 20≤t<30   | 10    | 23        | 23/10 = 2.3      |
| 30≤t<35   | 5     | 35        | 35/5 = 7.0       |
| 35≤t<40   | 5     | 52        | 52/5 = 10.4      |
| 40≤t<50   | 10    | 20        | 20/10 = 2.0      |
| 50≤t<70   | 20    | 12        | 12/20 = 0.6      |

**Step 2: Draw histogram**
- x-axis: Time (minutes) from 0 to 70
- y-axis: Frequency density from 0 to 10.4
- Draw bars with heights equal to frequency densities

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Calculate estimate of mean time**

### Solution:
**Step 1: Calculate midpoints**
- 0≤t<20: midpoint = 10
- 20≤t<30: midpoint = 25
- 30≤t<35: midpoint = 32.5
- 35≤t<40: midpoint = 37.5
- 40≤t<50: midpoint = 45
- 50≤t<70: midpoint = 60

**Step 2: Calculate mean**
Mean = (8×10 + 23×25 + 35×32.5 + 52×37.5 + 20×45 + 12×60)/150
     = (80 + 575 + 1137.5 + 1950 + 900 + 720)/150
     = 5362.5/150
     = 35.75

**Answer: 35.8 minutes**

### Part (c) [1 mark]
**Class interval containing lower quartile**

### Solution:
Total students = 150
Lower quartile position = 150/4 = 37.5th student

Cumulative frequencies:
- Up to 20: 8
- Up to 30: 8 + 23 = 31
- Up to 35: 31 + 35 = 66

The 37.5th student falls in the 30≤t<35 class.

**Answer: 30≤t<35**

## Question 4 [12 marks total]
**Rice bags: Small bags N(1.20, 0.16²), Large bags N(2.50, v²)**

### Part (a) [4 marks]
**Sample of 500 small bags: Expected number > 1.26 kg**

### Solution:
Let X = mass of small bag, X ~ N(1.20, 0.16²)

**Step 1: Standardize**
P(X > 1.26) = P(Z > (1.26-1.20)/0.16) = P(Z > 0.375)

**Step 2: Calculate probability**
P(Z > 0.375) = 1 - Φ(0.375) = 1 - 0.6462 = 0.3538

**Step 3: Expected number**
Expected number = 500 × 0.3538 = 176.9

**Answer: 177 bags**

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Find v given 20% of large bags < 2.40 kg**

### Solution:
Let Y = mass of large bag, Y ~ N(2.50, v²)

P(Y < 2.40) = 0.20

**Step 1: Standardize**
P(Z < (2.40-2.50)/v) = 0.20
P(Z < -0.1/v) = 0.20

**Step 2: Find critical z-value**
From normal tables: Φ(-0.842) = 0.20
So: -0.1/v = -0.842

**Step 3: Solve for v**
v = 0.1/0.842 = 0.119

**Answer: v = 0.119**

### Part (c) [5 marks]
**Sample of 80 large bags: P(fewer than 22 have mass < 2.40 kg)**

### Solution:
Let W = number of bags with mass < 2.40 kg, W ~ B(80, 0.20)

**Step 1: Use normal approximation**
Mean μ = np = 80 × 0.20 = 16
Variance σ² = np(1-p) = 80 × 0.20 × 0.80 = 12.8
Standard deviation σ = √12.8 = 3.578

**Step 2: Apply continuity correction**
P(W < 22) = P(W ≤ 21) ≈ P(Z ≤ 21.5) using continuity correction

**Step 3: Standardize**
P(Z ≤ (21.5-16)/√12.8) = P(Z ≤ 5.5/3.578) = P(Z ≤ 1.537)

**Step 4: Calculate probability**
P(Z ≤ 1.537) = Φ(1.537) = 0.938

**Answer: 0.938**

## Question 5 [8 marks total]
**Anil's tournament: Win (2 pts, p=0.5), Draw (1 pt, p=0.3), Loss (0 pts, p=0.2)**

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Show P(X = 2) = 0.114**

### Solution:
X = 2 points can occur in two ways:
1. Win, Loss, Loss (WLL): 2 + 0 + 0 = 2 points
2. Draw, Draw, Loss (DDL): 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 points

P(WLL) = 0.5 × 0.2 × 0.2 = 0.02
P(DDL) = ³C₂ × (0.3)² × 0.2 = 3 × 0.09 × 0.2 = 0.054

P(X = 2) = 0.02 + 0.054 = 0.074... 

Wait, let me recalculate:
P(WLL) = 0.5 × 0.2 × 0.2 = 0.02
But we need all arrangements: WLL, LWL, LLW = 3 × 0.02 = 0.06
P(DDL) = 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.2 = 0.018
All arrangements: DDL, DLD, LDD = 3 × 0.018 = 0.054

P(X = 2) = 0.06 + 0.054 = 0.114 ✓

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Complete probability distribution table**

### Solution:
Calculate remaining probabilities:

**P(X = 0):** LLL = (0.2)³ = 0.008
**P(X = 1):** DLL = ³C₁ × 0.3 × (0.2)² = 3 × 0.3 × 0.04 = 0.036
**P(X = 5):** WWD = ³C₂ × (0.5)² × 0.3 = 3 × 0.25 × 0.3 = 0.225
**P(X = 6):** WWW = (0.5)³ = 0.125

| x | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P(X=x) | 0.008 | 0.036 | 0.114 | 0.207 | 0.285 | 0.225 | 0.125 |

### Part (c) [3 marks]
**Find Var(X)**

### Solution:
**Step 1: Calculate E(X)**
E(X) = 0×0.008 + 1×0.036 + 2×0.114 + 3×0.207 + 4×0.285 + 5×0.225 + 6×0.125
     = 0 + 0.036 + 0.228 + 0.621 + 1.140 + 1.125 + 0.750 = 3.9

**Step 2: Calculate E(X²)**
E(X²) = 0²×0.008 + 1²×0.036 + 2²×0.114 + 3²×0.207 + 4²×0.285 + 5²×0.225 + 6²×0.125
      = 0 + 0.036 + 0.456 + 1.863 + 4.560 + 5.625 + 4.500 = 17.04

**Step 3: Calculate Var(X)**
Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]² = 17.04 - (3.9)² = 17.04 - 15.21 = 1.83

**Answer: Var(X) = 1.83**

### Part (a) [4 marks]
**Committee of 5: at least 2 men, at least 1 woman**

### Solution:
Need to enumerate valid scenarios:

**Scenario 1: 4 men, 1 woman**
⁶C₄ × ⁴C₁ = 15 × 4 = 60

**Scenario 2: 3 men, 2 women**
⁶C₃ × ⁴C₂ = 20 × 6 = 120

**Scenario 3: 2 men, 3 women**
⁶C₂ × ⁴C₃ = 15 × 4 = 60

Total ways = 60 + 120 + 60 = 240

**Answer: 240**

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**Line arrangement: all men together, all women together**

### Solution:
Treat men as one unit and women as one unit:
- Arrange 2 units: 2! = 2 ways
- Arrange 6 men within their unit: 6! ways
- Arrange 4 women within their unit: 4! ways

Total arrangements = 2! × 6! × 4! = 2 × 720 × 24 = 34,560

**Answer: 34,560**

### Part (c) [4 marks]
**Two rows (6 back, 4 front): Olly and Petra next to each other on front row**

### Solution:
**Step 1: Choose 2 additional people for front row**
Choose 2 from remaining 8 people: ⁸C₂ = 28

**Step 2: Arrange front row with Olly and Petra together**
- Treat OP as one unit with 2 other people: 3! arrangements of units
- Arrange OP within their unit: 2! arrangements
- Total front row arrangements: 3! × 2! = 12

**Step 3: Arrange back row**
Arrange 6 people in back row: 6! = 720

**Total arrangements = 28 × 12 × 720 = 241,920**

**Answer: 241,920**
