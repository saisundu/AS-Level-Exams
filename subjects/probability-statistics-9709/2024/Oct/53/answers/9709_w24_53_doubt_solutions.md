## Question 1(a): Electric Car Ownership Probability

**Problem**: 30% of residents own an electric car. Three residents are chosen at random. Find the probability that either all three own an electric car or none of them owns an electric car.

**Solution**:
Let p = 0.30 (probability of owning electric car)
Let q = 0.70 (probability of not owning electric car)

**Method**: Calculate P(all three own) + P(none owns)

P(all three own electric car) = p³ = 0.30³ = 0.027
P(none owns electric car) = q³ = 0.70³ = 0.343

**Total probability** = 0.027 + 0.343 = **0.37**

**Alternative approach**: 
Using complement: 1 - P(exactly 1 or exactly 2 own electric cars)
= 1 - [3C₁ × 0.30¹ × 0.70² + 3C₂ × 0.30² × 0.70¹]
= 1 - [3 × 0.30 × 0.49 + 3 × 0.09 × 0.70]
= 1 - [0.441 + 0.189]
= 1 - 0.63 = **0.37**

## Question 4(a): Cumulative Frequency Graph

**Problem**: Draw a cumulative frequency graph for sunflower plant heights.

**Data**:
| Height (cm) | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-44 | 45-49 | 50-54 | 55-59 |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Frequency   | 10    | 18    | 32    | 42    | 28    | 14    | 6     |

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Calculate cumulative frequencies
- Up to 19.5: 10
- Up to 29.5: 10 + 18 = 28
- Up to 39.5: 28 + 32 = 60
- Up to 44.5: 60 + 42 = 102
- Up to 49.5: 102 + 28 = 130
- Up to 54.5: 130 + 14 = 144
- Up to 59.5: 144 + 6 = 150

**Step 2**: Plot points at upper boundaries
- (9.5, 0) - starting point
- (19.5, 10)
- (29.5, 28)
- (39.5, 60)
- (44.5, 102)
- (49.5, 130)
- (54.5, 144)
- (59.5, 150)

**Step 3**: Graph requirements (from mark scheme)
- **Axes**: Height (9.5 to 59.5 cm) vs Cumulative Frequency (0 to 150)
- **Scale**: At least 1cm = 10 units
- **Points**: All plotted at upper boundaries ± 0.5
- **Curve**: Smooth curve through points (not straight line segments)

**Key marking points**:
- ✓ Cumulative frequencies: 28, 60, 102, 130, 144, 150
- ✓ Correctly scaled and labeled axes
- ✓ Points plotted accurately at upper boundaries
- ✓ Smooth curve drawn through all points

## Question 5(c): Conditional Probability with Chocolates

**Problem**: Find the probability that the second chocolate chosen is the first one wrapped in gold foil given that the fifth chocolate chosen is the first unwrapped chocolate.

**Given**:
- 30% gold foil, 25% red foil, 45% unwrapped
- Condition: 5th chocolate is first unwrapped

**Solution**:

**Method 1**: Direct calculation using conditional probability

P(2nd gold | 5th is first unwrapped) = P(2nd gold AND 5th is first unwrapped) / P(5th is first unwrapped)

**Step 1**: Calculate P(2nd gold AND 5th is first unwrapped)
For this to happen: positions 1-4 must all be wrapped, 2nd must be gold, 5th must be unwrapped

Possible sequences for positions 1-4 (with 2nd being gold):
- R G R G U: 0.25 × 0.30 × 0.25 × 0.30 × 0.45 = 0.00253125
- R G R R U: 0.25 × 0.30 × 0.25 × 0.25 × 0.45 = 0.002109375  
- R G G R U: 0.25 × 0.30 × 0.30 × 0.25 × 0.45 = 0.00253125
- R G G G U: 0.25 × 0.30 × 0.30 × 0.30 × 0.45 = 0.0030375

Total = 0.010209375

**Step 2**: Calculate P(5th is first unwrapped)
This means positions 1-4 are all wrapped (55% each), 5th is unwrapped (45%)
P(5th is first unwrapped) = 0.55⁴ × 0.45 = 0.041178

**Step 3**: Apply conditional probability formula
P(2nd gold | 5th is first unwrapped) = 0.010209375 / 0.041178 = **0.248**

**Alternative Method**: Using conditional probabilities directly
Given that we know chocolates 1-4 are wrapped:
- P(Red | wrapped) = 0.25/0.55 = 5/11
- P(Gold | wrapped) = 0.30/0.55 = 6/11

P(2nd is gold | 5th is first unwrapped) = 6/11 × 5/11 = **30/121 = 0.248**

## Question 6(c): Permutations with Constraints

**Problem**: Find the number of different arrangements of HAPPINESS where the two Ps are together and there are exactly two letters between the two Ss.

**Analysis of HAPPINESS**: H-A-P-P-I-N-E-S-S (9 letters: 2 Ps, 2 Ss, 5 others)

**Solution**:

**Method 1**: Consider Ss positions and PP as a unit

**Step 1**: Treat PP as one unit, so we have 8 objects to arrange
With constraint "exactly 2 letters between Ss", possible S positions:
- S _ _ S (positions 1,4), (2,5), (3,6), (4,7), (5,8)

**Step 2**: Calculate arrangements
For each valid S position pattern:
- Place the S-gap-gap-S pattern: various positions
- Arrange remaining letters including PP unit

**Detailed calculation**:
- Positions where S^^S can be placed: 6 possible positions
- When S^^S in positions 1-4 or 6: 5! ways to arrange remaining letters
- When S^^S in positions 2,3,4,5: 4×5! ways to arrange remaining letters

Total = 2×5×5! + 4×4×5! = 6! + 5!×5×4 = 720 + 2400 = **3120**

**Method 2**: Direct counting
**Case 1**: PP between the Ss
Pattern: S PP S ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
Number of ways = 6! = 720

**Case 2**: PP not between Ss  
Pattern: (S ^ ^ S) ^ PP ^ with various positions
Number of ways = 5! × 5 × 4 = 2400

**Total** = 720 + 2400 = **3120**

## Question 6(d): Probability of Group Division

**Problem**: The 9 letters in HAPPINESS are divided randomly into groups of 5 and 4. Find the probability that both Ps are in one group and both Ss are in the other group.

**Solution**:

**Method 1**: Using combinations

**Step 1**: Total ways to divide 9 letters into groups of 5 and 4
Total ways = C(9,5) = C(9,4) = 126

**Step 2**: Favorable outcomes
Either:
- Both Ps in group of 5, both Ss in group of 4, OR
- Both Ps in group of 4, both Ss in group of 5

**Case 1**: Ps in group of 5, Ss in group of 4
- Choose 3 more letters from remaining 5 for the group of 5: C(5,3) = 10
- The remaining 2 letters automatically go with Ss in group of 4

**Case 2**: Ps in group of 4, Ss in group of 5  
- Choose 2 more letters from remaining 5 for the group of 4: C(5,2) = 10
- The remaining 3 letters automatically go with Ss in group of 5

**Step 3**: Calculate probability
Favorable outcomes = 10 + 10 = 20
Total outcomes = 126

**Probability** = 20/126 = 10/63 ≈ **0.159**

**Method 2**: Using sequential probability
P = (5×4×4×3)/(9×8×7×6) + (4×3×5×4)/(9×8×7×6) = (240+240)/(3024) = 480/3024 = 10/63
