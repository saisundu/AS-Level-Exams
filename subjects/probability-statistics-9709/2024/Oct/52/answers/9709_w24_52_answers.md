### Question 1: Basic Probability and Independence [6 marks]

Student distribution:
- Year 1: Tennis (16), Hockey (22), Netball (12) = 50 total
- Year 2: Tennis (24), Hockey (18), Netball (28) = 70 total
- Total students: 120
- Total netball players: 12 + 28 = 40

**(a) Find P(X ∩ N) [1 mark]**

P(X ∩ N) = P(Year 1 and Netball) = 12/120 = 1/10 = 0.1

**(b) Find P(N|X) [1 mark]**

P(N|X) = P(N ∩ X)/P(X) = (12/120)/(50/120) = 12/50 = 6/25 = 0.24

**(c) Determine whether X and N are independent [1 mark]**

For independence: P(X ∩ N) = P(X) × P(N)

P(X) = 50/120 = 5/12
P(N) = 40/120 = 1/3
P(X) × P(N) = (5/12) × (1/3) = 5/36

P(X ∩ N) = 1/10 = 36/360 = 9/90
P(X) × P(N) = 5/36 = 50/360

Since 1/10 ≠ 5/36, X and N are NOT independent.

**(d) Find probability of fewer than 3 successes in 8 shots with p = 0.15 [3 marks]**

Let Y ~ B(8, 0.15)
P(Y < 3) = P(Y = 0) + P(Y = 1) + P(Y = 2)

P(Y = 0) = C(8,0) × (0.15)⁰ × (0.85)⁸ = 1 × 1 × 0.2725 = 0.2725
P(Y = 1) = C(8,1) × (0.15)¹ × (0.85)⁷ = 8 × 0.15 × 0.3206 = 0.3848
P(Y = 2) = C(8,2) × (0.15)² × (0.85)⁶ = 28 × 0.0225 × 0.3771 = 0.2378

P(Y < 3) = 0.2725 + 0.3848 + 0.2378 = 0.895

### Question 2: Combinatorics and Arrangements [4 marks]

Word: ALGEBRAIC (9 letters: A-2, L-1, G-1, E-1, B-1, R-1, I-1, C-1)

**(a) Find number of arrangements of ALGEBRAIC [1 mark]**

Number of arrangements = 9!/2! = 362880/2 = 181,440

**(b) Find arrangements with no more than two letters between the two As [3 marks]**

"No more than two letters between the As" means the As can be:
- Adjacent (0 letters between)
- 1 letter between
- 2 letters between

Case 1: As adjacent (AA)
Treat AA as one unit. Arrange 8 units: 8! = 40,320

Case 2: 1 letter between As (A_A)
Choose positions for A_A: 7 ways (positions 1-3, 2-4, ..., 7-9)
Arrange remaining 7 letters: 7! = 5,040
Total: 7 × 5,040 = 35,280

Case 3: 2 letters between As (A_ _A)
Choose positions for A_ _A: 6 ways (positions 1-4, 2-5, ..., 6-9)
Arrange remaining 7 letters: 7! = 5,040
Total: 6 × 5,040 = 30,240

Total arrangements = 40,320 + 35,280 + 30,240 = 105,840

### Question 3: Discrete Probability Distribution [6 marks]

Fair coin and fair dice thrown together.
- Tail: X = 2 × dice score
- Head: X = dice score if even, X = 0 if odd

**(a) Draw up probability distribution table for X [3 marks]**

Possible outcomes:
- Tail + 1: X = 2, P = (1/2)(1/6) = 1/12
- Tail + 2: X = 4, P = (1/2)(1/6) = 1/12
- Tail + 3: X = 6, P = (1/2)(1/6) = 1/12
- Tail + 4: X = 8, P = (1/2)(1/6) = 1/12
- Tail + 5: X = 10, P = (1/2)(1/6) = 1/12
- Tail + 6: X = 12, P = (1/2)(1/6) = 1/12
- Head + 1: X = 0, P = (1/2)(1/6) = 1/12
- Head + 2: X = 2, P = (1/2)(1/6) = 1/12
- Head + 3: X = 0, P = (1/2)(1/6) = 1/12
- Head + 4: X = 4, P = (1/2)(1/6) = 1/12
- Head + 5: X = 0, P = (1/2)(1/6) = 1/12
- Head + 6: X = 6, P = (1/2)(1/6) = 1/12

| X | 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|
| P(X) | 3/12 = 1/4 | 2/12 = 1/6 | 2/12 = 1/6 | 2/12 = 1/6 | 1/12 | 1/12 | 1/12 |

**(b) Find Var(X) [3 marks]**

E(X) = 0(1/4) + 2(1/6) + 4(1/6) + 6(1/6) + 8(1/12) + 10(1/12) + 12(1/12)
E(X) = 0 + 2/6 + 4/6 + 6/6 + 8/12 + 10/12 + 12/12
E(X) = 0 + 1/3 + 2/3 + 1 + 2/3 + 5/6 + 1
E(X) = (4 + 8 + 12 + 8 + 10 + 12)/12 = 54/12 = 4.5

E(X²) = 0²(1/4) + 2²(1/6) + 4²(1/6) + 6²(1/6) + 8²(1/12) + 10²(1/12) + 12²(1/12)
E(X²) = 0 + 4/6 + 16/6 + 36/6 + 64/12 + 100/12 + 144/12
E(X²) = (8 + 32 + 72 + 64 + 100 + 144)/12 = 420/12 = 35

Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]² = 35 - (4.5)² = 35 - 20.25 = 14.75

### Question 4: Normal Distribution Applications [7 marks]

**(a) Expected number of white pine trees with height < 18.2m [4 marks]**

White pine trees: X ~ N(19.8, 2.4²)

Standardize: Z = (18.2 - 19.8)/2.4 = -1.6/2.4 = -2/3 ≈ -0.667

P(X < 18.2) = P(Z < -0.667) = Φ(-0.667) = 1 - Φ(0.667) = 1 - 0.7475 = 0.2525

Expected number = 450 × 0.2525 = 113.6 ≈ 114 trees

**(b) Find value of v for red pine trees [3 marks]**

Red pine trees: Y ~ N(23.4, v²)
Given: P(Y > 25.5) = 0.26

P(Y > 25.5) = 0.26
P(Y ≤ 25.5) = 0.74

Standardize: P((25.5 - 23.4)/v ≤ Z) = 0.74
P(2.1/v ≤ Z) = 0.74

From normal tables: Φ(0.643) = 0.74
Therefore: 2.1/v = 0.643
v = 2.1/0.643 = 3.27

### Question 5: Combinations with Constraints [6 marks]

Class: 10 violinists, 6 guitarists, 5 pianists (21 total)

**(a) Ways to choose group of 7: 4 violinists, 2 guitarists, 1 pianist [2 marks]**

Number of ways = C(10,4) × C(6,2) × C(5,1)
= 210 × 15 × 5 = 15,750

**(b) Ways to choose group of 5: at least 2 violinists, at least 1 guitarist, at most 1 pianist [4 marks]**

Constraints:
- At least 2 violinists (2, 3, 4, or 5)
- At least 1 guitarist (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5)
- At most 1 pianist (0 or 1)

Since we need 5 people total, possible combinations:

Case 1: 2V, 2G, 1P
Ways = C(10,2) × C(6,2) × C(5,1) = 45 × 15 × 5 = 3,375

Case 2: 2V, 3G, 0P
Ways = C(10,2) × C(6,3) × C(5,0) = 45 × 20 × 1 = 900

Case 3: 3V, 1G, 1P
Ways = C(10,3) × C(6,1) × C(5,1) = 120 × 6 × 5 = 3,600

Case 4: 3V, 2G, 0P
Ways = C(10,3) × C(6,2) × C(5,0) = 120 × 15 × 1 = 1,800

Case 5: 4V, 1G, 0P
Ways = C(10,4) × C(6,1) × C(5,0) = 210 × 6 × 1 = 1,260

Total ways = 3,375 + 900 + 3,600 + 1,800 + 1,260 = 10,935

### Question 6: Data Representation and Analysis [10 marks]

Falcons: 38, 39, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 64, 69, 76
Kites: 32, 40, 40, 45, 47, 48, 52, 54, 58, 59, 59, 60, 61, 63, 65

**(a) Back-to-back stem-and-leaf diagram [4 marks]**

```
Falcons | Stem | Kites
        |  3   | 2
    9 8 |  4   | 0 0 5 7 8
  8 6 4 |  5   | 2 4 8 9 9
    2 1 |  5   | 9 0 1 3 5
    9   |  6   |
    6   |  7   |
```

Key: 3|2 represents 32 minutes

**(b) Find median and IQR for Falcons [3 marks]**

Falcons (ordered): 38, 39, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 64, 69, 76

n = 15
Median = 8th value = 51 minutes

Q1 = 4th value = 44 minutes
Q3 = 12th value = 59 minutes
IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 59 - 44 = 15 minutes

**(c) Find mean and standard deviation for all 30 runners [3 marks]**

Given:
- Falcons: Σx = 792, Σx² = 43,504
- Kites: Σy = 783, Σy² = 42,223

Combined data (30 runners):
Mean = (792 + 783)/30 = 1575/30 = 52.5 minutes

For standard deviation:
Σ(all values)² = 43,504 + 42,223 = 85,727

Variance = (85,727/30) - (52.5)² = 2857.57 - 2756.25 = 101.32
Standard deviation = √101.32 = 10.1 minutes

### Question 7: Geometric and Binomial Distributions [11 marks]

Leno's goal scoring: p = 0.4 per attempt

**(a) Find P(X = 5) [1 mark]**

X ~ Geo(0.4)
P(X = 5) = (0.6)⁴ × 0.4 = 0.1296 × 0.4 = 0.0518

**(b) Find P(3 ≤ X ≤ 7) [2 marks]**

P(3 ≤ X ≤ 7) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) + P(X = 6) + P(X = 7)

P(X = 3) = (0.6)² × 0.4 = 0.144
P(X = 4) = (0.6)³ × 0.4 = 0.0864
P(X = 5) = (0.6)⁴ × 0.4 = 0.0518
P(X = 6) = (0.6)⁵ × 0.4 = 0.0311
P(X = 7) = (0.6)⁶ × 0.4 = 0.0187

P(3 ≤ X ≤ 7) = 0.144 + 0.0864 + 0.0518 + 0.0311 + 0.0187 = 0.332

**(c) Find probability of second goal on or before 5th attempt [3 marks]**

This is negative binomial: need exactly 2 successes, with 2nd success on attempt 2, 3, 4, or 5.

P(2nd goal on attempt k) = C(k-1,1) × (0.4)² × (0.6)^(k-2)

P(2nd on 2nd) = C(1,1) × (0.4)² × (0.6)⁰ = 1 × 0.16 × 1 = 0.16
P(2nd on 3rd) = C(2,1) × (0.4)² × (0.6)¹ = 2 × 0.16 × 0.6 = 0.192
P(2nd on 4th) = C(3,1) × (0.4)² × (0.6)² = 3 × 0.16 × 0.36 = 0.1728
P(2nd on 5th) = C(4,1) × (0.4)² × (0.6)³ = 4 × 0.16 × 0.216 = 0.1382

Total probability = 0.16 + 0.192 + 0.1728 + 0.1382 = 0.663

**(d) Use approximation for P(28 < Y < 35) with n = 75 [5 marks]**

Let Y ~ B(75, 0.4)

μ = np = 75 × 0.4 = 30
σ² = np(1-p) = 75 × 0.4 × 0.6 = 18
σ = √18 = 4.243

Since n is large and np, n(1-p) > 5, use normal approximation:
Y ~ N(30, 18)

P(28 < Y < 35) = P(28.5 ≤ Y ≤ 34.5) with continuity correction

Standardize:
P((28.5-30)/4.243 ≤ Z ≤ (34.5-30)/4.243)
P(-0.354 ≤ Z ≤ 1.061)
P(28 < Y < 35) = Φ(1.061) - Φ(-0.354)
P(28 < Y < 35) = 0.8556 - (1 - 0.6383)
P(28 < Y < 35) = 0.8556 - 0.3617 = 0.494
