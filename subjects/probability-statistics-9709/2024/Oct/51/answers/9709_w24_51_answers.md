### Question 1: Geometric Distribution [6 marks]

Nicola throws an ordinary fair six-sided dice. The random variable X is the number of throws that she takes to obtain a 6.

**(a) Find P(X ≥ 8) [2 marks]**

For a geometric distribution, X ~ Geo(p) where p = 1/6 (probability of success on each trial).

P(X ≥ 8) = P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10) + ...

Using the complement:
P(X ≥ 8) = 1 - P(X ≤ 7)
P(X ≥ 8) = 1 - P(X < 8)
P(X ≥ 8) = 1 - [1 - (1-p)^7]
P(X ≥ 8) = (1-p)^7
P(X ≥ 8) = (5/6)^7

P(X ≥ 8) = 78125/279936 = 0.279

**(b) Find the probability that Nicola obtains a 6 for the second time on her 8th throw [2 marks]**

This follows a negative binomial distribution. We need exactly 2 successes in 8 trials, with the 8th trial being a success.

This means we need exactly 1 success in the first 7 trials, then a success on the 8th trial.

P(second 6 on 8th throw) = C(7,1) × (1/6)^1 × (5/6)^6 × (1/6)
P(second 6 on 8th throw) = 7 × (1/6) × (5/6)^6 × (1/6)
P(second 6 on 8th throw) = 7 × (1/6)^2 × (5/6)^6
P(second 6 on 8th throw) = 7 × (1/36) × (15625/46656)
P(second 6 on 8th throw) = 7 × 15625/(36 × 46656)
P(second 6 on 8th throw) = 109375/1679616 = 0.0651

### Question 2: Discrete Probability Distribution [6 marks]

The random variable X takes the values -2, -1, 0, 2, 3. It is given that P(X = x) = k(x + 2)², where k is a positive constant.

**(a) Draw up the probability distribution table for X, giving the probabilities as numerical fractions [3 marks]**

For each value of x:
- P(X = -2) = k(-2 + 2)² = k(0)² = 0
- P(X = -1) = k(-1 + 2)² = k(1)² = k
- P(X = 0) = k(0 + 2)² = k(2)² = 4k
- P(X = 2) = k(2 + 2)² = k(4)² = 16k
- P(X = 3) = k(3 + 2)² = k(5)² = 25k

Since probabilities must sum to 1:
0 + k + 4k + 16k + 25k = 1
46k = 1
k = 1/46

| x | -2 | -1 | 0 | 2 | 3 |
|---|----|----|---|---|---|
| P(X = x) | 0 | 1/46 | 4/46 | 16/46 | 25/46 |

**(b) Find the value of Var(X) [3 marks]**

First, find E(X):
E(X) = (-2)(0) + (-1)(1/46) + (0)(4/46) + (2)(16/46) + (3)(25/46)
E(X) = 0 - 1/46 + 0 + 32/46 + 75/46
E(X) = 106/46 = 53/23

Next, find E(X²):
E(X²) = (-2)²(0) + (-1)²(1/46) + (0)²(4/46) + (2)²(16/46) + (3)²(25/46)
E(X²) = 0 + 1/46 + 0 + 64/46 + 225/46
E(X²) = 290/46 = 145/23

Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]²
Var(X) = 145/23 - (53/23)²
Var(X) = 145/23 - 2809/529
Var(X) = (145 × 23 - 2809)/529
Var(X) = (3335 - 2809)/529
Var(X) = 526/529

### Question 3: Data Representation and Analysis [8 marks]

The time taken, in minutes, to walk to school was recorded for 200 pupils.

| Time taken (t minutes) | t ≤ 15 | t ≤ 25 | t ≤ 30 | t ≤ 40 | t ≤ 50 | t ≤ 70 |
|------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Cumulative frequency   | 18     | 46     | 88     | 140    | 176    | 200    |

**(a) Draw a cumulative frequency graph to illustrate the data [2 marks]**

Plot points: (15, 18), (25, 46), (30, 88), (40, 140), (50, 176), (70, 200)
Connect with smooth curve.

**(b) Use your graph to estimate the median and the interquartile range of the data [3 marks]**

Median position = 200/2 = 100th value
From graph: Median ≈ 32 minutes

Q1 position = 200/4 = 50th value
From graph: Q1 ≈ 26 minutes

Q3 position = 3 × 200/4 = 150th value
From graph: Q3 ≈ 45 minutes

Interquartile range = Q3 - Q1 = 45 - 26 = 19 minutes

**(c) Calculate an estimate for the mean value of the times taken by the 200 pupils to walk to school [3 marks]**

First, find frequencies for each interval:
- 0 < t ≤ 15: 18 pupils
- 15 < t ≤ 25: 46 - 18 = 28 pupils
- 25 < t ≤ 30: 88 - 46 = 42 pupils
- 30 < t ≤ 40: 140 - 88 = 52 pupils
- 40 < t ≤ 50: 176 - 140 = 36 pupils
- 50 < t ≤ 70: 200 - 176 = 24 pupils

Using midpoints:
Mean = [18(7.5) + 28(20) + 42(27.5) + 52(35) + 36(45) + 24(60)]/200
Mean = [135 + 560 + 1155 + 1820 + 1620 + 1440]/200
Mean = 6730/200 = 33.65 minutes

### Question 4: Conditional Probability and Tree Diagrams [6 marks]

Rahul has two bags:
- Bag X: 4 red, 2 blue marbles
- Bag Y: 3 red, 4 blue marbles
- Biased coin: P(Head) = 1/4

Process:
- Head → Choose from bag X with replacement
- Tail → Choose from bag Y without replacement

**(a) Find the probability that the two marbles that Rahul chooses are the same colour [3 marks]**

P(Head) = 1/4, P(Tail) = 3/4

For bag X (with replacement):
- P(Red) = 4/6 = 2/3, P(Blue) = 2/6 = 1/3
- P(2 Red | Head) = (2/3)² = 4/9
- P(2 Blue | Head) = (1/3)² = 1/9
- P(Same colour | Head) = 4/9 + 1/9 = 5/9

For bag Y (without replacement):
- P(2 Red | Tail) = (3/7) × (2/6) = 6/42 = 1/7
- P(2 Blue | Tail) = (4/7) × (3/6) = 12/42 = 2/7
- P(Same colour | Tail) = 1/7 + 2/7 = 3/7

P(Same colour) = P(Head) × P(Same | Head) + P(Tail) × P(Same | Tail)
P(Same colour) = (1/4) × (5/9) + (3/4) × (3/7)
P(Same colour) = 5/36 + 9/28
P(Same colour) = (5×7 + 9×9)/(36×7) = (35 + 81)/252 = 116/252 = 29/63

**(b) Find the probability that the two marbles that Rahul chooses are both from bag Y given that both marbles are blue [3 marks]**

P(Both blue from Y) = P(Tail) × P(2 Blue | Tail) = (3/4) × (2/7) = 6/28 = 3/14

P(Both blue from X) = P(Head) × P(2 Blue | Head) = (1/4) × (1/9) = 1/36

P(Both blue) = 3/14 + 1/36 = (3×18 + 1×7)/(14×18) = (54 + 7)/252 = 61/252

P(From Y | Both blue) = P(Both blue from Y)/P(Both blue) = (3/14)/(61/252) = (3/14) × (252/61) = 54/61

### Question 5: Normal Distribution Applications [9 marks]

Green apples: X ~ N(90, 8²)

**(a) Find the probability that a randomly chosen green apple weighs between 83 grams and 95 grams [4 marks]**

Standardize: Z = (X - 90)/8

P(83 < X < 95) = P((83-90)/8 < Z < (95-90)/8)
P(83 < X < 95) = P(-0.875 < Z < 0.625)
P(83 < X < 95) = Φ(0.625) - Φ(-0.875)
P(83 < X < 95) = Φ(0.625) - [1 - Φ(0.875)]
P(83 < X < 95) = 0.7340 - (1 - 0.8092)
P(83 < X < 95) = 0.7340 - 0.1908 = 0.543

**(b) Use a suitable approximation to find the probability that fewer than 105 of the chosen red apples weigh more than 80 grams [5 marks]**

Given: n = 160, p = 0.6 (60% weigh more than 80g)

Since n is large and np = 96, n(1-p) = 64 (both > 5), use normal approximation.

Let Y = number weighing more than 80g
Y ~ B(160, 0.6) ≈ N(96, 38.4)

μ = np = 160 × 0.6 = 96
σ² = np(1-p) = 160 × 0.6 × 0.4 = 38.4
σ = √38.4 = 6.197

With continuity correction:
P(Y < 105) = P(Y ≤ 104.5)

Standardize: Z = (104.5 - 96)/6.197 = 1.372

P(Y < 105) = Φ(1.372) = 0.915

### Question 6: Normal Distribution Parameters [8 marks]

Heights of female students: X ~ N(μ, σ²)
- 90% have heights < 182.7 cm
- 40% have heights < 162.5 cm

**(a) Find the mean and the standard deviation [5 marks]**

From the given information:
P(X < 182.7) = 0.9 → Φ((182.7 - μ)/σ) = 0.9
P(X < 162.5) = 0.4 → Φ((162.5 - μ)/σ) = 0.4

From normal tables:
Φ⁻¹(0.9) = 1.282
Φ⁻¹(0.4) = -0.253

Therefore:
(182.7 - μ)/σ = 1.282 ... (1)
(162.5 - μ)/σ = -0.253 ... (2)

From (1): 182.7 - μ = 1.282σ
From (2): 162.5 - μ = -0.253σ

Subtracting (2) from (1):
182.7 - 162.5 = 1.282σ - (-0.253σ)
20.2 = 1.535σ
σ = 20.2/1.535 = 13.16

Substituting back into (1):
182.7 - μ = 1.282 × 13.16 = 16.87
μ = 182.7 - 16.87 = 165.8

Mean = 165.8 cm, Standard deviation = 13.16 cm

**(b) Find the probability that fewer than 8 of these 10 students have heights more than 162.5 cm [3 marks]**

P(X > 162.5) = 1 - P(X < 162.5) = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6

Let Y = number with heights > 162.5 cm
Y ~ B(10, 0.6)

P(Y < 8) = P(Y ≤ 7) = 1 - P(Y ≥ 8) = 1 - [P(Y = 8) + P(Y = 9) + P(Y = 10)]

P(Y = 8) = C(10,8) × (0.6)⁸ × (0.4)² = 45 × 0.01679 × 0.16 = 0.1209
P(Y = 9) = C(10,9) × (0.6)⁹ × (0.4)¹ = 10 × 0.01007 × 0.4 = 0.0403
P(Y = 10) = C(10,10) × (0.6)¹⁰ × (0.4)⁰ = 1 × 0.00605 × 1 = 0.0060

P(Y < 8) = 1 - (0.1209 + 0.0403 + 0.0060) = 1 - 0.1672 = 0.833

### Question 7: Combinatorics and Arrangements [7 marks]

Word: INTELLECT (9 letters: I-1, N-1, T-2, E-2, L-2, C-1)

**(a) How many different arrangements are there of the 9 letters in which the two Ts are together? [2 marks]**

Treat the two Ts as one unit. We now have 8 units to arrange: (TT), I, N, E, E, L, L, C

Number of arrangements = 8!/(2! × 2!) = 40320/4 = 10080

**(b) How many different arrangements are there in which there is a T at each end and the two Es are not next to each other? [3 marks]**

With T at each end: T _ _ _ _ _ _ _ T

We need to arrange the remaining 7 letters (I, N, E, E, L, L, C) in the 7 middle positions such that the two Es are not adjacent.

Total arrangements of 7 letters = 7!/(2! × 2!) = 5040/4 = 1260

Arrangements where Es are together:
Treat EE as one unit. Arrange 6 units (EE, I, N, L, L, C) = 6!/2! = 720/2 = 360

Arrangements where Es are not together = 1260 - 360 = 900

**(c) Find the percentage of the possible selections which contain at least one E and exactly one T [4 marks]**

Total ways to select 4 letters from 9: C(9,4) = 126

For "at least one E and exactly one T":
- Select 1 T from 2 Ts: C(2,1) = 2
- Select at least 1 E from 2 Es: C(2,1) + C(2,2) = 2 + 1 = 3
- Select remaining letters from {I, N, L, L, C} (5 letters)

Case 1: 1 T, 1 E, 2 from {I, N, L, L, C}
Ways = C(2,1) × C(2,1) × C(5,2) = 2 × 2 × 10 = 40

Case 2: 1 T, 2 E, 1 from {I, N, L, L, C}
Ways = C(2,1) × C(2,2) × C(5,1) = 2 × 1 × 5 = 10

Total favorable outcomes = 40 + 10 = 50

Percentage = (50/126) × 100% = 39.7%
