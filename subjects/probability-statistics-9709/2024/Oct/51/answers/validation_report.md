- ✅ **Accuracy Mark (A1)**: Answer 0.279 matches mark scheme requirement (0.720918... for P(X < 8), so P(X ≥ 8) = 0.279)

**(b) Find probability of second 6 on 8th throw [2 marks] - ACHIEVED: 2/2**
- ✅ **Method Mark (M1)**: Correctly identified negative binomial structure with C(7,1) × (5/6)^6 × (1/6)^2
