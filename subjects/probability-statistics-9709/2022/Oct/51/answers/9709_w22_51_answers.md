## Question 1 [4 marks]
**Topic: Probability Distributions and Expected Value**

Given probability distribution table for random variable X:
- x: -2, -1, 0.5, 1, 2
- P(X = x): 0.12, p, q, 0.16, 0.3
- E(X) = 0.28

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** Use the fact that probabilities sum to 1
∑P(X = x) = 1
0.12 + p + q + 0.16 + 0.3 = 1
p + q = 1 - 0.58 = 0.42

**Step 2:** Use the expected value formula
E(X) = ∑x·P(X = x) = 0.28
(-2)(0.12) + (-1)(p) + (0.5)(q) + (1)(0.16) + (2)(0.3) = 0.28
-0.24 - p + 0.5q + 0.16 + 0.6 = 0.28
-p + 0.5q = 0.28 - 0.52 = -0.24

**Step 3:** Solve the system of equations
From equation 1: p + q = 0.42
From equation 2: -p + 0.5q = -0.24

From equation 1: p = 0.42 - q
Substitute into equation 2:
-(0.42 - q) + 0.5q = -0.24
-0.42 + q + 0.5q = -0.24
1.5q = 0.18
q = 0.12

Therefore: p = 0.42 - 0.12 = 0.3

**Answer:** p = 0.3, q = 0.12

## Question 2 [8 marks]
**Topic: Binomial Distribution and Normal Approximation**

Survey results: 12% poor, 36% satisfactory, 52% good

### Part (a) [3 marks]
Sample of 8 residents. Find P(more than 2 and fewer than 8 rate service as poor or satisfactory).

**Solution:**

P(poor or satisfactory) = 0.12 + 0.36 = 0.48
Let X = number rating service as poor or satisfactory
X ~ B(8, 0.48)

We need P(2 < X < 8) = P(X = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)

Using complement: P(3 ≤ X ≤ 7) = 1 - P(X = 0, 1, 2, 8)

P(X = 0) = C(8,0)(0.48)⁰(0.52)⁸ = 0.005346
P(X = 1) = C(8,1)(0.48)¹(0.52)⁷ = 0.039478
P(X = 2) = C(8,2)(0.48)²(0.52)⁶ = 0.127544
P(X = 8) = C(8,8)(0.48)⁸(0.52)⁰ = 0.002818

P(3 ≤ X ≤ 7) = 1 - (0.005346 + 0.039478 + 0.127544 + 0.002818) = 1 - 0.175186 = 0.825

**Answer:** 0.825

### Part (b) [5 marks]
Sample of 125 residents. Find P(more than 72 rate service as good) using approximation.

**Solution:**

Let Y = number rating service as good
Y ~ B(125, 0.52)

For normal approximation:
μ = np = 125 × 0.52 = 65
σ² = np(1-p) = 125 × 0.52 × 0.48 = 31.2
σ = √31.2 = 5.586

Using continuity correction: P(Y > 72) = P(Y ≥ 72.5)

Standardizing: Z = (72.5 - 65)/5.586 = 7.5/5.586 = 1.343

P(Y > 72) = P(Z > 1.343) = 1 - Φ(1.343) = 1 - 0.9104 = 0.0896

**Answer:** 0.0896

## Question 3 [9 marks]
**Topic: Data Representation and Descriptive Statistics**

Heights (cm) of basketball players:
- Lions: 178, 186, 181, 187, 179, 190, 189, 190, 180, 169, 196
- Tigers: 194, 179, 187, 190, 183, 201, 184, 180, 195, 191, 197

### Part (a) [4 marks]
Draw back-to-back stem-and-leaf diagram with Lions on left.

**Solution:**

```
Lions          Tigers
    9 | 16 |      
  9 8 | 17 | 9    
9 7 6 1 0 | 18 | 0 3 4 7
  6 0 0 | 19 | 0 1 4 5 7
        | 20 | 1    

Key: 1|18|3 means 181 cm for Lions and 183 cm for Tigers
```

### Part (b) [3 marks]
Find median and interquartile range for Lions.

**Solution:**

Lions data in order: 169, 178, 179, 180, 181, 186, 187, 189, 190, 190, 196

n = 11, so median is 6th value = 186 cm

For quartiles:
- Lower quartile (Q₁) = 179 cm (3rd value)
- Upper quartile (Q₃) = 190 cm (9th value)

IQR = Q₃ - Q₁ = 190 - 179 = 11 cm

**Answer:** Median = 186 cm, IQR = 11 cm

### Part (c) [2 marks]
Make two comparisons between Lions and Tigers heights.

**Solution:**

Given for Tigers: Q₁ = 183 cm, Median = 190 cm, Q₃ = 195 cm

**Comparison 1 (Central tendency):** Tigers are generally taller than Lions (median 190 cm vs 186 cm).

**Comparison 2 (Spread):** Heights of Tigers are slightly less consistent than Lions (IQR = 195 - 183 = 12 cm vs 11 cm for Lions).

## Question 4 [9 marks]
**Topic: Normal Distribution**

Adult SBP: N(125.4, 18.6²)
Children SBP: N(117, σ²) with 88% having SBP > 108

### Part (a) [2 marks]
Find P(adult SBP < 132).

**Solution:**

Let X ~ N(125.4, 18.6²)

P(X < 132) = P(Z < (132 - 125.4)/18.6) = P(Z < 0.3548)

Using standard normal tables: P(Z < 0.355) = 0.639

**Answer:** 0.639

### Part (b) [3 marks]
Find standard deviation for children's distribution.

**Solution:**

Let Y ~ N(117, σ²)
Given: P(Y > 108) = 0.88
Therefore: P(Y ≤ 108) = 0.12

Standardizing: P(Z ≤ (108 - 117)/σ) = 0.12
P(Z ≤ -9/σ) = 0.12

From tables: Φ(-1.175) = 0.12
So: -9/σ = -1.175
σ = 9/1.175 = 7.66

**Answer:** σ = 7.66

### Part (c) [4 marks]
Find P(each of three adults has SBP within 1.5 standard deviations of mean).

**Solution:**

For one adult, SBP within 1.5 standard deviations means:
125.4 - 1.5(18.6) < X < 125.4 + 1.5(18.6)
97.5 < X < 153.3

P(-1.5 < Z < 1.5) = Φ(1.5) - Φ(-1.5) = Φ(1.5) - (1 - Φ(1.5)) = 2Φ(1.5) - 1
= 2(0.9332) - 1 = 0.8664

For three independent adults:
P(all three within 1.5 SD) = (0.8664)³ = 0.650

**Answer:** 0.650

## Question 5 [10 marks]
**Topic: Tree Diagrams and Conditional Probability**

Game with fair die: If result is 2,3,4,5 → that's the score. If result is 1,6 → throw again, score = sum.

### Part (a) [2 marks]
Draw fully labelled tree diagram.

**Solution:**

```
First throw:
    1/6 → 1 → Second throw: 1/6 each to 1,2,3,4,5,6 → Scores: 2,3,4,5,6,7
    1/6 → 2 → Score: 2
    1/6 → 3 → Score: 3
    1/6 → 4 → Score: 4
    1/6 → 5 → Score: 5
    1/6 → 6 → Second throw: 1/6 each to 1,2,3,4,5,6 → Scores: 7,8,9,10,11,12
```

### Part (b) [3 marks]
Show that P(A) = 1/3, where A: score is 5,6,7,8,9.

**Solution:**

From tree diagram:
- Score 5: Direct (1/6) + from 1+4 (1/6 × 1/6) = 1/6 + 1/36 = 7/36
- Score 6: From 1+5 (1/6 × 1/6) = 1/36
- Score 7: From 1+6 (1/6 × 1/6) + from 6+1 (1/6 × 1/6) = 2/36
- Score 8: From 6+2 (1/6 × 1/6) = 1/36
- Score 9: From 6+3 (1/6 × 1/6) = 1/36

P(A) = 7/36 + 1/36 + 2/36 + 1/36 + 1/36 = 12/36 = 1/3 ✓

### Part (c) [2 marks]
Determine if events A and B are independent, where B: player has two throws.

**Solution:**

P(B) = P(first throw is 1 or 6) = 2/6 = 1/3
P(A ∩ B) = P(score 5,6,7,8,9 with two throws) = 6/36 = 1/6

For independence: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)
P(A) × P(B) = 1/3 × 1/3 = 1/9
P(A ∩ B) = 1/6 ≠ 1/9

**Answer:** Events A and B are not independent.

### Part (d) [3 marks]
Find P(B|A').

**Solution:**

A' = {score is 2,3,4,10,11,12}
P(A') = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3

P(B ∩ A') = P(score 10,11,12 with two throws) = 3/36 = 1/12

P(B|A') = P(B ∩ A')/P(A') = (1/12)/(2/3) = 1/12 × 3/2 = 1/4

**Answer:** P(B|A') = 1/4

## Question 6 [10 marks]
**Topic: Combinations and Arrangements**

Social club: 15 members (8 men, 7 women)

### Part (a) [4 marks]
Find number of ways to form 5-member committee with more men than women.

**Solution:**

More men than women means: 5M0W, 4M1W, or 3M2W

5M0W: C(8,5) × C(7,0) = 56 × 1 = 56
4M1W: C(8,4) × C(7,1) = 70 × 7 = 490
3M2W: C(8,3) × C(7,2) = 56 × 21 = 1176

Total = 56 + 490 + 1176 = 1722

**Answer:** 1722

### Part (b) [3 marks]
Find ways to divide 15 members into groups of 3, 5, and 7.

**Solution:**

This is a multinomial coefficient:
15!/(3! × 5! × 7!) = C(15,3) × C(12,5) × C(7,7)
= 455 × 792 × 1 = 360,360

**Answer:** 360,360

### Part (c) [3 marks]
In back row of 7 people (Abel, Betty, Cally, Doug, Eve, Freya, Gino), find arrangements where Abel and Betty are together but Freya and Gino are not together.

**Solution:**

**Method:** Total with AB together - arrangements with AB together AND FG together

**Step 1:** Arrangements with AB together
Treat AB as one unit: 6 units to arrange = 6!
AB can be arranged internally in 2! ways
Total with AB together = 6! × 2! = 1440

**Step 2:** Arrangements with AB together AND FG together
Treat AB as one unit and FG as one unit: 5 units to arrange = 5!
AB can be arranged in 2! ways, FG in 2! ways
Total with both together = 5! × 2! × 2! = 480

**Step 3:** Required arrangements
AB together but FG not together = 1440 - 480 = 960

**Answer:** 960
