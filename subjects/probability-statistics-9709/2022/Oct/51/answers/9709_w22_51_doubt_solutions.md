## Question 1: Probability Distribution and Expected Value

**Problem**: Given the probability distribution table for random variable X:

| x | -2 | -1 | 0.5 | 1 | 2 |
|---|----|----|-----|---|---|
| P(X = x) | 0.12 | p | q | 0.16 | 0.3 |

Given that E(X) = 0.28, find the values of p and q.

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Use the condition that probabilities sum to 1
Since all probabilities must sum to 1:
0.12 + p + q + 0.16 + 0.3 = 1
0.58 + p + q = 1
**p + q = 0.42** ... (Equation 1)

**Step 2**: Use the given expected value
E(X) = Σ[x × P(X = x)] = 0.28

E(X) = (-2)(0.12) + (-1)(p) + (0.5)(q) + (1)(0.16) + (2)(0.3)
= -0.24 - p + 0.5q + 0.16 + 0.6
= 0.52 - p + 0.5q

Setting this equal to 0.28:
0.52 - p + 0.5q = 0.28
**-p + 0.5q = -0.24** ... (Equation 2)

**Step 3**: Solve the system of equations
From Equation 1: p = 0.42 - q
Substitute into Equation 2:
-(0.42 - q) + 0.5q = -0.24
-0.42 + q + 0.5q = -0.24
1.5q = -0.24 + 0.42
1.5q = 0.18
**q = 0.12**

From Equation 1: p = 0.42 - 0.12 = **0.3**

**Verification**:
- p + q = 0.3 + 0.12 = 0.42 ✓
- E(X) = -0.24 - 0.3 + 0.06 + 0.16 + 0.6 = 0.28 ✓

**Answer**: p = 0.3, q = 0.12

## Question 6: Combinations and Arrangements

### Part (a): Committee formation with more men than women

**Problem**: A Social Club has 15 members (8 men, 7 women). Find the number of ways to form a 5-member committee with more men than women.

**Solution**:

For more men than women in a 5-member committee, possible compositions are:
- 5 men, 0 women
- 4 men, 1 woman  
- 3 men, 2 women

**Case 1**: 5 men, 0 women
Ways = C(8,5) × C(7,0) = 56 × 1 = 56

**Case 2**: 4 men, 1 woman
Ways = C(8,4) × C(7,1) = 70 × 7 = 490

**Case 3**: 3 men, 2 women
Ways = C(8,3) × C(7,2) = 56 × 21 = 1176

**Total ways** = 56 + 490 + 1176 = **1722**

### Part (b): Dividing into three groups

**Problem**: In how many ways can 15 members be divided into groups of 3, 5, and 7?

**Solution**:

**Method**: Sequential selection
- Choose 3 people from 15 for the first group: C(15,3)
- Choose 5 people from remaining 12 for the second group: C(12,5)  
- Remaining 7 people automatically form the third group: C(7,7) = 1

Number of ways = C(15,3) × C(12,5) × C(7,7)
= 455 × 792 × 1
= **360,360**

### Part (c): Arrangements with constraints

**Problem**: 7 people (Abel, Betty, Cally, Doug, Eve, Freya, Gino) in back row. Find arrangements where Abel and Betty are next to each other AND Freya and Gino are NOT next to each other.

**Solution**:

**Method 1**: Total with AB together - arrangements with AB together AND FG together

**Step 1**: Arrangements with Abel and Betty together
Treat AB as one unit: (AB), C, D, E, F, G = 6 objects
- Ways to arrange these 6 objects: 6!
- Ways to arrange A and B within their unit: 2!
- Total with AB together: 6! × 2! = 720 × 2 = 1440

**Step 2**: Arrangements with AB together AND FG together  
Treat AB as one unit and FG as one unit: (AB), (FG), C, D, E = 5 objects
- Ways to arrange these 5 objects: 5!
- Ways to arrange A,B within their unit: 2!
- Ways to arrange F,G within their unit: 2!
- Total with both AB and FG together: 5! × 2! × 2! = 120 × 2 × 2 = 480

**Step 3**: Apply inclusion-exclusion principle
Arrangements with AB together BUT FG not together = 1440 - 480 = **960**

**Method 2**: Direct construction
**Step 1**: Place AB unit and arrange internally
- Treat AB as one unit among 6 objects: 6! ways
- Arrange A,B within unit: 2! ways
- Total: 6! × 2! = 1440 ways

**Step 2**: Place F and G separately (not together)
With AB as one unit, we have 6 positions. F and G must be in different positions.
- Choose 2 positions from 6 for F and G such that they're not the (AB) unit and not adjacent
- Available arrangements where F,G are separate: Use complement
- Ways to place F,G in remaining 4 individual positions: 4 × 3 = 12 ways
- But this excludes when F,G are together, so: 20 total arrangements - 8 where together = 12

Actually, let's use the systematic approach:
- Fix AB together: 6! × 2 = 1440
- Of these, subtract those where F,G are also together: 5! × 2 × 2 = 480  
- Result: 1440 - 480 = **960**

**Answer**: 960
