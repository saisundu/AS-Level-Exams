## Question 1 [3 marks]
**Topic: Variance from Coded Data**

Given: 50 values of variable x
- Σ(x - 20) = 35
- Σx² = 25,036

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** Find Σx
Σ(x - 20) = Σx - 50(20) = Σx - 1000 = 35
Therefore: Σx = 1035

**Step 2:** Find the mean
x̄ = Σx/n = 1035/50 = 20.7

**Step 3:** Calculate variance using the formula
Variance = (Σx²)/n - (x̄)²
Variance = 25036/50 - (20.7)²
Variance = 500.72 - 428.49 = 72.23

**Answer:** 72.23

## Question 2 [5 marks]
**Topic: Normal Approximation to Binomial Distribution**

32% of students have blue eyes. Sample of 80 students.
Find P(fewer than 20 have blue eyes).

**Solution:**

Let X ~ B(80, 0.32)

For normal approximation:
μ = np = 80 × 0.32 = 25.6
σ² = np(1-p) = 80 × 0.32 × 0.68 = 17.408
σ = √17.408 = 4.172

Using continuity correction: P(X < 20) = P(X ≤ 19.5)

Standardizing: Z = (19.5 - 25.6)/4.172 = -6.1/4.172 = -1.462

P(X < 20) = P(Z < -1.462) = 1 - Φ(1.462) = 1 - 0.9282 = 0.0718

**Answer:** 0.0718

## Question 3 [7 marks]
**Topic: Cumulative Frequency and Descriptive Statistics**

Walking challenge times for 250 members:

| Time (t minutes) | t≤20 | t≤30 | t≤35 | t≤40 | t≤50 | t≤60 |
|------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Cumulative freq  | 32   | 66   | 112  | 178  | 228  | 250  |

### Part (a) [2 marks]
Draw cumulative frequency graph.

**Solution:**

Plot points: (20,32), (30,66), (35,112), (40,178), (50,228), (60,250)
Join with smooth curve starting from (0,0).
Label axes: "Time (minutes)" and "Cumulative frequency"

### Part (b) [1 mark]
Use graph to estimate 60th percentile.

**Solution:**

60th percentile corresponds to 60% of 250 = 150 students
From graph, draw horizontal line from cf = 150 to meet curve
Read down to time axis: approximately 38 minutes

**Answer:** 38 minutes

### Part (c) [4 marks]
Calculate standard deviation (given mean = 34.4 minutes).

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** Find frequencies from cumulative frequencies
- 0-20: 32
- 20-30: 66-32 = 34  
- 30-35: 112-66 = 46
- 35-40: 178-112 = 66
- 40-50: 228-178 = 50
- 50-60: 250-228 = 22

**Step 2:** Find midpoints
10, 25, 32.5, 37.5, 45, 55

**Step 3:** Calculate variance
Variance = Σ(f × x²)/n - (mean)²

Σ(f × x²) = 32×10² + 34×25² + 46×32.5² + 66×37.5² + 50×45² + 22×55²
= 32×100 + 34×625 + 46×1056.25 + 66×1406.25 + 50×2025 + 22×3025
= 3200 + 21250 + 48587.5 + 92812.5 + 101250 + 66550 = 333650

Variance = 333650/250 - (34.4)² = 1334.6 - 1183.36 = 151.24

Standard deviation = √151.24 = 12.3

**Answer:** 12.3 minutes

## Question 4 [8 marks]
**Topic: Discrete Probability Distributions**

Three fair 4-sided spinners (sides 1,2,3,4). X = highest number recorded.

### Part (a) [3 marks]
Show that P(X = 2) = 7/64.

**Solution:**

Total possible outcomes = 4³ = 64

For X = 2, the highest number must be 2, so no spinner shows 3 or 4.
Possible outcomes: each spinner shows 1 or 2, with at least one showing 2.

Ways to get highest = 2:
- All show 1 or 2: 2³ = 8 ways
- All show 1: 1³ = 1 way
- At least one shows 2: 8 - 1 = 7 ways

P(X = 2) = 7/64 ✓

### Part (b) [2 marks]
Complete probability distribution table.

**Solution:**

P(X = 1) = P(all show 1) = (1/4)³ = 1/64

P(X = 3) = P(highest is 3) - P(highest is 2) - P(highest is 1)
= P(all show 1,2,3) - P(all show 1,2) - P(all show 1)
= (3/4)³ - (2/4)³ - (1/4)³ = 27/64 - 8/64 - 1/64 = 18/64

Wait, let me recalculate systematically:

P(X = 3): Highest is 3, so at least one shows 3, none shows 4
= P(all show 1,2,3) - P(all show 1,2)
= (3/4)³ - (2/4)³ = 27/64 - 8/64 = 19/64

P(X = 4): At least one shows 4
= 1 - P(all show 1,2,3) = 1 - (3/4)³ = 1 - 27/64 = 37/64

| x | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P(X=x) | 1/64 | 7/64 | 19/64 | 37/64 |

### Part (c) [1 mark]
One spinner spun repeatedly until 3 obtained. Y = number of spins. Find P(Y = 6).

**Solution:**

This is geometric distribution with p = 1/4.
P(Y = 6) = (1-p)^(6-1) × p = (3/4)⁵ × (1/4) = (243/1024) × (1/4) = 243/4096 ≈ 0.0593

**Answer:** 0.0593

### Part (d) [2 marks]
Find P(Y > 4).

**Solution:**

P(Y > 4) = (1-p)⁴ = (3/4)⁴ = 81/256 ≈ 0.316

**Answer:** 0.316

## Question 5 [9 marks]
**Topic: Binomial Distribution and Normal Distribution**

### Part (a) [3 marks]
Company A: 10% bags underweight. Sample of 10 bags.
Find P(fewer than 3 underweight).

**Solution:**

Let X ~ B(10, 0.1)
P(X < 3) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)

P(X = 0) = C(10,0)(0.1)⁰(0.9)¹⁰ = 1 × 1 × 0.3487 = 0.3487
P(X = 1) = C(10,1)(0.1)¹(0.9)⁹ = 10 × 0.1 × 0.3874 = 0.3874
P(X = 2) = C(10,2)(0.1)²(0.9)⁸ = 45 × 0.01 × 0.4305 = 0.1937

P(X < 3) = 0.3487 + 0.3874 + 0.1937 = 0.930

**Answer:** 0.930

### Part (b) [3 marks]
Company B: weights N(1.04, 0.06²). Find P(weight > 1.11kg).

**Solution:**

Let X ~ N(1.04, 0.06²)

P(X > 1.11) = P(Z > (1.11 - 1.04)/0.06) = P(Z > 1.167)

P(X > 1.11) = 1 - Φ(1.167) = 1 - 0.8784 = 0.122

**Answer:** 0.122

### Part (c) [3 marks]
81% of Company B bags weigh less than w kg. Find w.

**Solution:**

P(X < w) = 0.81
P(Z < (w - 1.04)/0.06) = 0.81

From tables: Φ(0.878) = 0.81
So: (w - 1.04)/0.06 = 0.878
w - 1.04 = 0.878 × 0.06 = 0.05268
w = 1.04 + 0.05268 = 1.09

**Answer:** w = 1.09

## Question 6 [10 marks]
**Topic: Arrangements and Combinations**

Word: ACTIVATED (A, C, T, I, V, A, T, E, D) - contains A(2), T(2), others single

### Part (a) [2 marks]
Find number of arrangements of ACTIVATED.

**Solution:**

Total letters = 9
Repeated letters: A appears 2 times, T appears 2 times

Number of arrangements = 9!/(2! × 2!) = 362880/4 = 90720

**Answer:** 90720

### Part (b) [3 marks]
Find arrangements with at least 5 letters between the two As.

**Solution:**

"At least 5 letters between As" means 5, 6, or 7 letters between them.

**Case 1:** Exactly 5 letters between As
Pattern: A _ _ _ _ _ A _ _
Positions for As: (1,7), (2,8), (3,9) = 3 ways
Arrange remaining 7 letters: 7!/2! = 2520 ways
Total: 3 × 2520 = 7560

**Case 2:** Exactly 6 letters between As  
Pattern: A _ _ _ _ _ _ A _
Positions for As: (1,8), (2,9) = 2 ways
Arrange remaining 7 letters: 7!/2! = 2520 ways
Total: 2 × 2520 = 5040

**Case 3:** Exactly 7 letters between As
Pattern: A _ _ _ _ _ _ _ A
Positions for As: (1,9) = 1 way
Arrange remaining 7 letters: 7!/2! = 2520 ways
Total: 1 × 2520 = 2520

Total arrangements = 7560 + 5040 + 2520 = 15120

**Answer:** 15120

### Part (c) [5 marks]
5 letters selected randomly. Find P(selection does not contain more Ts than As).

**Solution:**

Available letters: A(2), T(2), C(1), I(1), V(1), E(1), D(1)

Total ways to select 5 letters = C(9,5) = 126

"Does not contain more Ts than As" means:
- Number of Ts ≤ Number of As

**Favorable cases:**
1. **0T, 0A:** Choose 5 from {C,I,V,E,D} = C(5,5) = 1
2. **0T, 1A:** Choose 1A, 4 from {C,I,V,E,D} = C(2,1) × C(5,4) = 2 × 5 = 10  
3. **0T, 2A:** Choose 2A, 3 from {C,I,V,E,D} = C(2,2) × C(5,3) = 1 × 10 = 10
4. **1T, 1A:** Choose 1T, 1A, 3 from {C,I,V,E,D} = C(2,1) × C(2,1) × C(5,3) = 2 × 2 × 10 = 40
5. **1T, 2A:** Choose 1T, 2A, 2 from {C,I,V,E,D} = C(2,1) × C(2,2) × C(5,2) = 2 × 1 × 10 = 20
6. **2T, 2A:** Choose 2T, 2A, 1 from {C,I,V,E,D} = C(2,2) × C(2,2) × C(5,1) = 1 × 1 × 5 = 5

Total favorable = 1 + 10 + 10 + 40 + 20 + 5 = 86

P(does not contain more Ts than As) = 86/126 = 43/63 ≈ 0.683

**Answer:** 43/63

## Question 7 [8 marks]
**Topic: Conditional Probability with Sequential Events**

Game with 5 white, 3 red discs. Players take turns removing discs (no replacement).
Game ends when player removes 2nd red disc (that player wins).
Sam goes first.

### Part (a) [2 marks]
Find P(Tom removes red disc on his first turn).

**Solution:**

For Tom to have a first turn, Sam must not remove 2 red discs on his first two turns.

P(Tom gets first turn) = P(Sam doesn't win in first 2 turns)

Tom removes red on his first turn means:
- Sam's first disc: red or white
- If Sam's first is red, Sam's second must be white
- If Sam's first is white, Sam's second can be anything except red-red sequence

P(Sam removes red first) × P(Tom removes red) + P(Sam removes white first) × P(Tom removes red)

= (3/8) × (2/7) + (5/8) × (3/7) = 6/56 + 15/56 = 21/56 = 3/8

**Answer:** 3/8

### Part (b) [4 marks]
Find P(Tom wins on his second turn).

**Solution:**

Tom wins on his second turn means he removes his 2nd red disc on his 2nd turn.
This requires Tom to remove exactly 1 red on his first turn, then 1 red on his second turn.

Possible sequences (S=Sam, T=Tom, R=red, W=white):
1. **RRWR:** Sam(R), Sam(W), Tom(R), Tom(R)
2. **WRRR:** Sam(W), Sam(R), Tom(R), Tom(R)  
3. **WRWR:** Sam(W), Sam(W), Tom(R), Tom(R)

P(RRWR) = (3/8) × (5/7) × (2/6) × (1/5) = 30/1680
P(WRRR) = (5/8) × (3/7) × (2/6) × (1/5) = 30/1680
P(WRWR) = (5/8) × (4/7) × (3/6) × (2/5) = 120/1680

P(Tom wins on 2nd turn) = 30/1680 + 30/1680 + 120/1680 = 180/1680 = 3/28

**Answer:** 3/28

### Part (c) [2 marks]
Find P(Sam removes red on first turn | Tom wins on second turn).

**Solution:**

Using conditional probability:
P(Sam removes red first | Tom wins on 2nd turn) = P(Sam removes red first AND Tom wins on 2nd turn) / P(Tom wins on 2nd turn)

From part (b), only sequence RRWR has Sam removing red first:
P(Sam removes red first AND Tom wins on 2nd turn) = P(RRWR) = 30/1680 = 1/56

P(Sam removes red first | Tom wins on 2nd turn) = (1/56) / (3/28) = (1/56) × (28/3) = 1/6

**Answer:** 1/6
