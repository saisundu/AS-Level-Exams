## Question 4: Probability Distributions with Spinners

**Context**: Three fair 4-sided spinners with sides labeled 1, 2, 3, 4. Random variable X denotes the highest number recorded when all three are spun.

### Part (a): Show that P(X = 2) = 7/64

**Problem**: Prove that the probability of the maximum being 2 equals 7/64.

**Solution**:

**Method 1**: Direct enumeration of favorable outcomes

**Step 1**: Identify conditions for X = 2
For the maximum to be 2, at least one spinner must show 2, and no spinner can show 3 or 4.

**Step 2**: List all possible outcomes where max = 2
The possible combinations are:
- (2,2,2) - all show 2
- (2,2,1), (2,1,2), (1,2,2) - two show 2, one shows 1  
- (2,1,1), (1,2,1), (1,1,2) - one shows 2, two show 1

Total favorable outcomes = 1 + 3 + 3 = 7

**Step 3**: Calculate total possible outcomes
Each spinner has 4 outcomes, so total = 4³ = 64

**Step 4**: Calculate probability
P(X = 2) = 7/64 ✓

**Method 2**: Using complementary probability concepts

**Step 1**: P(X = 2) = P(max ≤ 2) - P(max ≤ 1)
P(max ≤ 2) = P(all spinners show 1 or 2) = (2/4)³ = 8/64
P(max ≤ 1) = P(all spinners show 1) = (1/4)³ = 1/64

**Step 2**: Calculate final probability
P(X = 2) = 8/64 - 1/64 = 7/64 ✓

### Part (b): Complete the probability distribution table

**Problem**: Find P(X = 1) and P(X = 4).

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Find P(X = 1)
P(X = 1) = P(all spinners show 1) = (1/4)³ = **1/64**

**Step 2**: Find P(X = 4)
Total probability must equal 1:
P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) = 1
1/64 + 7/64 + 19/64 + P(X = 4) = 1
P(X = 4) = 1 - (1 + 7 + 19)/64 = 1 - 27/64 = **37/64**

**Complete probability distribution**:
| x | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P(X=x) | 1/64 | 7/64 | 19/64 | 37/64 |

### Part (c): Geometric distribution - P(Y = 6)

**Problem**: One spinner is spun until a 3 appears. Find P(Y = 6) where Y is number of spins needed.

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Identify the distribution
Y follows a geometric distribution with p = P(getting 3) = 1/4

**Step 2**: Apply geometric probability formula
P(Y = 6) = (1-p)^(6-1) × p = (3/4)^5 × (1/4)

**Step 3**: Calculate
P(Y = 6) = (243/1024) × (1/4) = 243/4096 = **0.0593**

### Part (d): Find P(Y > 4)

**Problem**: Find the probability that more than 4 spins are needed.

**Solution**:

**Method 1**: Direct calculation
P(Y > 4) = (1-p)^4 = (3/4)^4 = 81/256 = **0.316**

**Method 2**: Using complement
P(Y > 4) = 1 - P(Y ≤ 4)
P(Y ≤ 4) = P(Y=1) + P(Y=2) + P(Y=3) + P(Y=4)
= (1/4) + (3/4)(1/4) + (3/4)²(1/4) + (3/4)³(1/4)
= (1/4)[1 + 3/4 + 9/16 + 27/64] = (1/4)(175/64) = 175/256

P(Y > 4) = 1 - 175/256 = 81/256 = **0.316** ✓

## Question 6: Combinatorics with Letters

**Context**: Letters from the word ACTIVATED (A, C, T, I, V, A, T, E, D) - contains 2 As, 2 Ts, and 5 other distinct letters.

### Part (a): Total arrangements

**Problem**: Find the number of different arrangements of the 9 letters.

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Apply permutation formula for repeated elements
Total arrangements = 9!/(2! × 2!) 

**Step 2**: Calculate
= 362,880/(2 × 2) = 362,880/4 = **90,720**

### Part (b): Arrangements with at least 5 letters between the As

**Problem**: Find arrangements where there are at least 5 letters between the two As.

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Identify scenarios
- Exactly 5 letters between As (gap of 5)
- Exactly 6 letters between As (gap of 6)  
- Exactly 7 letters between As (gap of 7)

**Step 2**: Calculate each scenario
**Gap of 5**: Fix As in positions where 5 letters separate them
Number of such positions = 3 (positions 1&7, 2&8, 3&9)
For each position: arrange remaining 7 letters with 2 identical Ts = 7!/2!
Total for gap 5 = 3 × (7!/2!) = 3 × 2520 = 7,560

**Gap of 6**: 2 possible positions
Total for gap 6 = 2 × (7!/2!) = 2 × 2520 = 5,040

**Gap of 7**: 1 possible position  
Total for gap 7 = 1 × (7!/2!) = 1 × 2520 = 2,520

**Step 3**: Sum all scenarios
Total = 7,560 + 5,040 + 2,520 = **15,120**

### Part (c): Selection probability

**Problem**: Five letters selected randomly. Find probability that selection does not contain more Ts than As.

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Count total ways to select 5 letters from 9
Total ways = C(9,5) = 126

**Step 2**: Count favorable selections (≤ Ts than As)
Let's enumerate by number of As and Ts:

**0 As, 0 Ts**: C(5,5) = 1 way
**1 A, 0 Ts**: C(2,1) × C(5,4) = 2 × 5 = 10 ways  
**1 A, 1 T**: C(2,1) × C(2,1) × C(5,3) = 2 × 2 × 10 = 40 ways
**2 As, 0 Ts**: C(2,2) × C(5,3) = 1 × 10 = 10 ways
**2 As, 1 T**: C(2,2) × C(2,1) × C(5,2) = 1 × 2 × 10 = 20 ways
**2 As, 2 Ts**: C(2,2) × C(2,2) × C(5,1) = 1 × 1 × 5 = 5 ways

**Step 3**: Sum favorable outcomes
Total favorable = 1 + 10 + 40 + 10 + 20 + 5 = 86

**Step 4**: Calculate probability
P = 86/126 = 43/63 = **0.683**
