## Question 1 [5 marks]
**Topic: Conditional Probability and Law of Total Probability**

Kino travels to school by bus (0.2), car (0.1), or foot (0.7).
- P(late | bus) = x
- P(late | car) = 2x  
- P(late | foot) = 0.25
- P(late) = 0.235

### Part (a) [3 marks]
Find the value of x.

**Solution:**

Using the law of total probability:
P(late) = P(late | bus) × P(bus) + P(late | car) × P(car) + P(late | foot) × P(foot)

0.235 = x × 0.2 + 2x × 0.1 + 0.25 × 0.7
0.235 = 0.2x + 0.2x + 0.175
0.235 = 0.4x + 0.175
0.4x = 0.235 - 0.175 = 0.06
x = 0.15

**Answer:** x = 0.15

### Part (b) [2 marks]
Find P(car | not late).

**Solution:**

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(car | not late) = P(car and not late) / P(not late)

P(car and not late) = P(not late | car) × P(car) = (1 - 2x) × 0.1 = (1 - 0.3) × 0.1 = 0.07

P(not late) = 1 - P(late) = 1 - 0.235 = 0.765

P(car | not late) = 0.07 / 0.765 = 14/153 ≈ 0.0915

**Answer:** 0.0915

## Question 2 [7 marks]
**Topic: Normal Distribution**

Rod lengths: N(55.6, 1.2²)

### Part (a) [4 marks]
In sample of 400 rods, how many expected to have length < 54.8mm?

**Solution:**

Let X ~ N(55.6, 1.2²)

P(X < 54.8) = P(Z < (54.8 - 55.6)/1.2) = P(Z < -0.6667)

Using standard normal tables: P(Z < -0.667) = 1 - Φ(0.667) = 1 - 0.7477 = 0.2523

Expected number = 400 × 0.2523 = 100.92 ≈ 101

**Answer:** 101 rods

### Part (b) [3 marks]
Find P(rod length within half a standard deviation of mean).

**Solution:**

Within half a standard deviation means: 55.6 - 0.5(1.2) < X < 55.6 + 0.5(1.2)
55.0 < X < 56.2

P(55.0 < X < 56.2) = P(-0.5 < Z < 0.5) = Φ(0.5) - Φ(-0.5) = Φ(0.5) - (1 - Φ(0.5))
= 2Φ(0.5) - 1 = 2(0.6915) - 1 = 0.383

**Answer:** 0.383

## Question 3 [5 marks]
**Topic: Geometric Distribution**

Three fair dice thrown repeatedly. Score = sum of uppermost faces.

### Part (a) [3 marks]
Find P(score ≥ 17 first obtained on 6th throw).

**Solution:**

First, find P(score ≥ 17) on single throw.
For three dice, minimum sum = 3, maximum sum = 18.
Score ≥ 17 means score = 17 or 18.

Ways to get 17: (5,6,6), (6,5,6), (6,6,5) = 3 ways
Ways to get 18: (6,6,6) = 1 way
Total ways ≥ 17: 4 ways
Total possible outcomes: 6³ = 216

P(score ≥ 17) = 4/216 = 1/54

For geometric distribution, P(first success on trial n) = (1-p)^(n-1) × p

P(first ≥ 17 on 6th throw) = (53/54)⁵ × (1/54) = (53/54)⁵ × (1/54) ≈ 0.0169

**Answer:** 0.0169

### Part (b) [2 marks]
Find P(score ≥ 17 obtained in fewer than 8 throws).

**Solution:**

P(success in fewer than 8 throws) = 1 - P(no success in first 7 throws)
= 1 - (53/54)⁷ ≈ 1 - 0.8775 = 0.123

**Answer:** 0.123

## Question 4 [7 marks]
**Topic: Histograms and Descriptive Statistics**

Time data for 250 employees:

| Time (t minutes) | 0≤t<20 | 20≤t<40 | 40≤t<50 | 50≤t<60 | 60≤t<100 |
|------------------|---------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Frequency        | 32      | 46       | 96       | 52       | 24        |

### Part (a) [4 marks]
Draw histogram.

**Solution:**

Calculate frequency densities:
- Class width: 20, 20, 10, 10, 40
- Frequency density = frequency ÷ class width

| Class | Frequency | Class Width | Frequency Density |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 0-20  | 32        | 20          | 1.6               |
| 20-40 | 46        | 20          | 2.3               |
| 40-50 | 96        | 10          | 9.6               |
| 50-60 | 52        | 10          | 5.2               |
| 60-100| 24        | 40          | 0.6               |

**Histogram:** Draw bars with heights 1.6, 2.3, 9.6, 5.2, 0.6 respectively, with x-axis labeled "Time (minutes)" and y-axis labeled "Frequency density".

### Part (b) [3 marks]
Calculate estimate for standard deviation (given mean = 43.2).

**Solution:**

Using midpoints: 10, 30, 45, 55, 80

Variance = Σ(f × x²)/n - (mean)²

Σ(f × x²) = 32×10² + 46×30² + 96×45² + 52×55² + 24×80²
= 32×100 + 46×900 + 96×2025 + 52×3025 + 24×6400
= 3200 + 41400 + 194400 + 157300 + 153600 = 549900

Variance = 549900/250 - (43.2)² = 2199.6 - 1866.24 = 333.36

Standard deviation = √333.36 = 18.3

**Answer:** 18.3 minutes

## Question 5 [7 marks]
**Topic: Probability with Biased Coins**

Eric has 3 coins: 1 fair, 2 biased with P(H) = 1/4.

Events:
- A: all three coins show same result
- B: at least one biased coin shows head

### Part (a) [2 marks]
Show that P(B) = 7/16.

**Solution:**

P(B) = 1 - P(both biased coins show tails)
P(both biased coins show tails) = (3/4) × (3/4) = 9/16
P(B) = 1 - 9/16 = 7/16 ✓

### Part (b) [2 marks]
Find P(A|B).

**Solution:**

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

For A ∩ B, we need all same AND at least one biased head.
This means all three heads (HHH).

P(HHH) = (1/2) × (1/4) × (1/4) = 1/32

P(A|B) = (1/32) / (7/16) = (1/32) × (16/7) = 1/14

**Answer:** 1/14

### Part (c) [3 marks]
Draw probability distribution table for X = number of heads.

**Solution:**

Calculate all possible outcomes:

P(X = 0) = P(TTT) = (1/2) × (3/4) × (3/4) = 9/32

P(X = 1) = P(HTT) + P(THT) + P(TTH) = (1/2)(3/4)(3/4) + (1/2)(1/4)(3/4) + (1/2)(3/4)(1/4) = 9/32 + 3/32 + 3/32 = 15/32

P(X = 2) = P(HHT) + P(HTH) + P(THH) = (1/2)(1/4)(3/4) + (1/2)(3/4)(1/4) + (1/2)(1/4)(1/4) = 3/32 + 3/32 + 1/32 = 7/32

P(X = 3) = P(HHH) = (1/2) × (1/4) × (1/4) = 1/32

| X | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P(X) | 9/32 | 15/32 | 7/32 | 1/32 |

## Question 6 [9 marks]
**Topic: Binomial Distribution and Normal Approximation**

Call center: 90% of callers connected immediately.

### Part (a) [3 marks]
Sample of 12 callers. Find P(fewer than 10 connected immediately).

**Solution:**

Let X ~ B(12, 0.9)
P(X < 10) = P(X ≤ 9) = 1 - P(X ≥ 10) = 1 - [P(X = 10) + P(X = 11) + P(X = 12)]

P(X = 10) = C(12,10)(0.9)¹⁰(0.1)² = 66 × 0.3487 × 0.01 = 0.2301
P(X = 11) = C(12,11)(0.9)¹¹(0.1)¹ = 12 × 0.3138 × 0.1 = 0.3766
P(X = 12) = C(12,12)(0.9)¹²(0.1)⁰ = 1 × 0.2824 × 1 = 0.2824

P(X < 10) = 1 - (0.2301 + 0.3766 + 0.2824) = 1 - 0.8891 = 0.111

**Answer:** 0.111

### Part (b) [5 marks]
Sample of 80 callers. Find P(more than 69 connected immediately) using approximation.

**Solution:**

Let Y ~ B(80, 0.9)
For normal approximation: μ = np = 80 × 0.9 = 72, σ² = np(1-p) = 80 × 0.9 × 0.1 = 7.2

Using continuity correction: P(Y > 69) = P(Y ≥ 69.5)

Z = (69.5 - 72)/√7.2 = -2.5/2.683 = -0.932

P(Y > 69) = P(Z > -0.932) = Φ(0.932) = 0.824

**Answer:** 0.824

### Part (c) [1 mark]
Justify the approximation.

**Solution:**

np = 72 > 5 and n(1-p) = 8 > 5, so normal approximation is valid.

## Question 7 [10 marks]
**Topic: Arrangements and Combinations**

Word: ALLIGATOR (A, L, L, I, G, A, T, O, R)

### Part (a) [2 marks]
Find arrangements where both As together and both Ls together.

**Solution:**

Treat AA as one unit and LL as one unit.
We have: (AA), (LL), I, G, T, O, R = 7 units

Number of arrangements = 7! = 5040

**Answer:** 5040

### Part (b) [5 marks]
Find P(Ls together and exactly 6 letters between As).

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** Arrangements with Ls together and 6 letters between As

Pattern: A _ _ _ _ _ _ A with LL somewhere in the 6 middle positions.
- Choose 5 positions from remaining 7 letters for the 6 middle positions: 5! ways
- LL can be in any of the 5 positions among the 6 middle positions: 5 ways  
- LL can be arranged in 2! ways: 2 ways

Total favorable = 5! × 5 × 2 = 120 × 5 × 2 = 1200

**Step 2:** Total arrangements of ALLIGATOR

Total = 9!/(2! × 2!) = 362880/4 = 90720

**Step 3:** Probability

P = 1200/90720 = 5/378 ≈ 0.0132

**Answer:** 5/378

### Part (c) [3 marks]
Find selections of 5 letters containing at least one A and at most one L.

**Solution:**

Cases:
1. **1A, 0L, 4 others:** C(2,1) × C(2,0) × C(5,4) = 2 × 1 × 5 = 10
2. **2A, 0L, 3 others:** C(2,2) × C(2,0) × C(5,3) = 1 × 1 × 10 = 10  
3. **1A, 1L, 3 others:** C(2,1) × C(2,1) × C(5,3) = 2 × 2 × 10 = 40
4. **2A, 1L, 2 others:** C(2,2) × C(2,1) × C(5,2) = 1 × 2 × 10 = 20

Total = 10 + 10 + 40 + 20 = 80

Wait, let me recalculate this more carefully:

Available letters: A(2), L(2), I(1), G(1), T(1), O(1), R(1) = 5 other distinct letters

Cases for at least 1A and at most 1L:
1. **1A, 0L, 4 others:** C(2,1) × C(2,0) × C(5,4) = 2 × 1 × 5 = 10
2. **2A, 0L, 3 others:** C(2,2) × C(2,0) × C(5,3) = 1 × 1 × 10 = 10
3. **1A, 1L, 3 others:** C(2,1) × C(2,1) × C(5,3) = 2 × 2 × 10 = 40
4. **2A, 1L, 2 others:** C(2,2) × C(2,1) × C(5,2) = 1 × 2 × 10 = 20

But we need to be more careful about the "others". Let me reconsider:

Actually, the 5 other letters are I, G, T, O, R (all distinct).

1. **A _ _ _ _** (1A, 0L): Choose 4 from {I,G,T,O,R} = C(5,4) = 5
2. **AA _ _ _** (2A, 0L): Choose 3 from {I,G,T,O,R} = C(5,3) = 10  
3. **AL _ _ _** (1A, 1L): Choose 3 from {I,G,T,O,R} = C(5,3) = 10
4. **AAL _ _** (2A, 1L): Choose 2 from {I,G,T,O,R} = C(5,2) = 10

Total = 5 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 35

**Answer:** 35
