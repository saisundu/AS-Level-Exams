## Question 1 [5 marks total]
**Two spinners: Red (1, 2, 2, 3) and Blue (-3, -2, -1, -1). X = sum of results.**

### Part (a) [3 marks]
**Draw up probability distribution table for X.**

### Solution:
Red spinner probabilities:
- P(1) = 1/4, P(2) = 2/4 = 1/2, P(3) = 1/4

Blue spinner probabilities:
- P(-3) = 1/4, P(-2) = 1/4, P(-1) = 2/4 = 1/2

Possible values of X = Red + Blue:
- X = 1 + (-3) = -2: P = (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16
- X = 1 + (-2) = -1: P = (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16
- X = 1 + (-1) = 0: P = (1/4)(1/2) = 2/16 = 1/8
- X = 2 + (-3) = -1: P = (1/2)(1/4) = 2/16 = 1/8
- X = 2 + (-2) = 0: P = (1/2)(1/4) = 2/16 = 1/8
- X = 2 + (-1) = 1: P = (1/2)(1/2) = 4/16 = 1/4
- X = 3 + (-3) = 0: P = (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16
- X = 3 + (-2) = 1: P = (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16
- X = 3 + (-1) = 2: P = (1/4)(1/2) = 2/16 = 1/8

Combining probabilities:
- P(X = -2) = 1/16
- P(X = -1) = 1/16 + 2/16 = 3/16
- P(X = 0) = 2/16 + 2/16 + 1/16 = 5/16
- P(X = 1) = 4/16 + 1/16 = 5/16
- P(X = 2) = 2/16 = 1/8

| X | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 |
|---|----|----|---|---|---|
| P(X) | 1/16 | 3/16 | 5/16 | 5/16 | 1/8 |

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**Given E(X) = 0.25, find Var(X).**

### Solution:
E(X) = (-2)(1/16) + (-1)(3/16) + (0)(5/16) + (1)(5/16) + (2)(1/8)
     = -2/16 - 3/16 + 0 + 5/16 + 4/16
     = 4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25 ✓

E(X²) = (-2)²(1/16) + (-1)²(3/16) + (0)²(5/16) + (1)²(5/16) + (2)²(1/8)
      = 4/16 + 3/16 + 0 + 5/16 + 8/16
      = 20/16 = 5/4 = 1.25

Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]²
       = 5/4 - (1/4)²
       = 5/4 - 1/16
       = 20/16 - 1/16 = 19/16

**Answer: Var(X) = 19/16**

## Question 2 [6 marks total]
**Rain probability: P(>10cm rain) = 0.18 per day, independent.**

### Part (a) [3 marks]
**Find P(more than 2 days have >10cm rain in 7-day period).**

### Solution:
Let Y = number of days with >10cm rain in 7 days
Y ~ B(7, 0.18)

P(Y > 2) = 1 - P(Y ≤ 2) = 1 - [P(Y=0) + P(Y=1) + P(Y=2)]

P(Y=0) = ⁷C₀(0.18)⁰(0.82)⁷ = (0.82)⁷ = 0.249285
P(Y=1) = ⁷C₁(0.18)¹(0.82)⁶ = 7(0.18)(0.82)⁶ = 0.383048
P(Y=2) = ⁷C₂(0.18)²(0.82)⁵ = 21(0.18)²(0.82)⁵ = 0.252251

P(Y > 2) = 1 - (0.249285 + 0.383048 + 0.252251) = 1 - 0.884584 = 0.115416

**Answer: 0.115**

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**For 3 periods, find P(exactly 2 have at least 1 day with >10cm rain).**

### Solution:
First find P(at least 1 day with >10cm rain in 7-day period):
P(at least 1) = 1 - P(0) = 1 - (0.82)⁷ = 1 - 0.249285 = 0.750715

Let Z = number of periods (out of 3) with at least 1 day of >10cm rain
Z ~ B(3, 0.750715)

P(Z = 2) = ³C₂(0.750715)²(0.249285)¹ = 3(0.750715)²(0.249285) = 0.4213

**Answer: 0.421**

## Question 3 [6 marks total]
**Arithmetic test times for 250 children.**

| Time (minutes) | 1-30 | 31-45 | 46-65 | 66-75 | 76-100 |
|----------------|------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| Frequency      | 21   | 30    | 68    | 86    | 45     |

### Part (a) [4 marks]
**Draw histogram.**

### Solution:
First calculate class widths and frequency densities:

| Class | Width | Frequency | Frequency Density |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1-30  | 30    | 21        | 21/30 = 0.7      |
| 31-45 | 15    | 30        | 30/15 = 2.0      |
| 46-65 | 20    | 68        | 68/20 = 3.4      |
| 66-75 | 10    | 86        | 86/10 = 8.6      |
| 76-100| 25    | 45        | 45/25 = 1.8      |

Draw histogram with time on x-axis and frequency density on y-axis.

### Part (b) [1 mark]
**State which class contains the median.**

### Solution:
Total frequency = 250
Median position = 125th value

Cumulative frequencies:
- Up to 30: 21
- Up to 45: 21 + 30 = 51
- Up to 65: 51 + 68 = 119
- Up to 75: 119 + 86 = 205

The 125th value falls in the 66-75 class.

**Answer: 66-75 minutes**

### Part (c) [1 mark]
**What feature accounts for median and mean being different?**

### Solution:
Given mean = 61.05 minutes and median is in 66-75 class (approximately 70.5).
Since mean < median, the distribution is negatively skewed (skewed to the left).

**Answer: The distribution is negatively skewed**

## Question 4 [11 marks total]
**Male leopards: N(55, 6²). Female leopards: N(42, σ²).**

### Part (a) [4 marks]
**Find P(male leopard weighs between 46 and 62 kg).**

### Solution:
Let X = weight of male leopard, X ~ N(55, 6²)

P(46 < X < 62) = P((46-55)/6 < Z < (62-55)/6)
                = P(-1.5 < Z < 1.167)
                = Φ(1.167) - Φ(-1.5)
                = Φ(1.167) - (1 - Φ(1.5))
                = 0.8784 - (1 - 0.9332)
                = 0.8784 - 0.0668 = 0.8116

**Answer: 0.812**

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Find σ given 25% of females weigh less than 36 kg.**

### Solution:
Let Y = weight of female leopard, Y ~ N(42, σ²)

P(Y < 36) = 0.25
P(Z < (36-42)/σ) = 0.25
P(Z < -6/σ) = 0.25

From normal tables: Φ(-0.674) = 0.25
So: -6/σ = -0.674
σ = 6/0.674 = 8.90

**Answer: σ = 8.90**

### Part (c) [4 marks]
**Find P(both male and female weigh less than 46 kg).**

### Solution:
For male: P(X < 46) = P(Z < (46-55)/6) = P(Z < -1.5) = 1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668

For female: P(Y < 46) = P(Z < (46-42)/8.90) = P(Z < 0.449) = 0.6736

Since weights are independent:
P(both < 46) = P(X < 46) × P(Y < 46) = 0.0668 × 0.6736 = 0.0450

**Answer: 0.0450**

## Question 5 [10 marks total]
**Group: 3 boys, 4 girls, 5 adults (12 people total).**

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Ways to choose 5 people with exactly 1 adult.**

### Solution:
Choose 1 adult from 5: ⁵C₁ = 5
Choose 4 people from remaining 7 (3 boys + 4 girls): ⁷C₄ = 35

Total ways = 5 × 35 = 175

**Answer: 175**

### Part (b) [4 marks]
**Ways to choose 5 people with at least 2 boys and at least 1 girl.**

### Solution:
Need to enumerate all valid scenarios systematically:

**Scenario 1: 2 boys, 1 girl, 2 adults**
³C₂ × ⁴C₁ × ⁵C₂ = 3 × 4 × 10 = 120

**Scenario 2: 2 boys, 2 girls, 1 adult**
³C₂ × ⁴C₂ × ⁵C₁ = 3 × 6 × 5 = 90

**Scenario 3: 2 boys, 3 girls, 0 adults**
³C₂ × ⁴C₃ × ⁵C₀ = 3 × 4 × 1 = 12

**Scenario 4: 3 boys, 1 girl, 1 adult**
³C₃ × ⁴C₁ × ⁵C₁ = 1 × 4 × 5 = 20

**Scenario 5: 3 boys, 2 girls, 0 adults**
³C₃ × ⁴C₂ × ⁵C₀ = 1 × 6 × 1 = 6

Total = 120 + 90 + 12 + 20 + 6 = 248

**Answer: 248**

### Part (c) [4 marks]
**Arrangements with 3 boys together and adults at both ends.**

### Solution:
Choose 2 adults for the ends: ⁵P₂ = 5 × 4 = 20
Treat the 3 boys as one unit: arrange this unit with remaining 7 people = 8! arrangements
Within the boys unit: 3! arrangements

But we need adults at BOTH ends:
- Choose 2 adults from 5 for ends: ⁵P₂ = 20
- Arrange remaining 3 adults and 4 girls and 1 boys-unit in middle 8 positions: 8!
- Arrange boys within their unit: 3!

Wait, let me recalculate:
- Adults at both ends: ⁵P₂ = 20 ways
- Middle 8 positions filled by: 3 adults, 4 girls, 1 boys-unit = 8! ways
- Boys within unit: 3! ways

Total = 20 × 8! × 3! = 20 × 40320 × 6 = 4,838,400

**Answer: 4,838,400**

## Question 6 [18 marks total]
**Chocolates in ratio 3:5:7 (lemon:orange:strawberry).**

### Part (a) [1 mark]
**P(first lemon is 7th chocolate).**

### Solution:
P(lemon) = 3/(3+5+7) = 3/15 = 1/5
P(not lemon) = 12/15 = 4/5

P(first lemon on 7th) = (4/5)⁶ × (1/5) = (4/5)⁶ × (1/5) = 0.0524

**Answer: 0.0524**

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**P(first lemon after at least 6 chocolates).**

### Solution:
P(first lemon after at least 6) = P(first 6 are not lemon)
                                 = (4/5)⁶ = 0.262

**Answer: 0.262**

### Part (c) [2 marks]
**P(none of 3 chocolates is orange) - sampling without replacement.**

### Solution:
Box contains: 3 lemon, 5 orange, 7 strawberry (15 total)
P(no orange) = P(all from 10 non-orange chocolates)

P(1st not orange) = 10/15
P(2nd not orange | 1st not orange) = 9/14
P(3rd not orange | first 2 not orange) = 8/13

P(none orange) = (10/15) × (9/14) × (8/13) = 720/2730 = 24/91

**Answer: 24/91**

### Part (d) [3 marks]
**P(each of 3 chocolates has different flavour).**

### Solution:
Ways to get one of each flavour (sampling without replacement):
- First chocolate: any flavour = 15/15 = 1
- Second chocolate: different flavour from first
- Third chocolate: different flavour from first two

Method: Calculate directly using sequential probability
P = (7×5×3)/(15×14×13) × 3! = (105×6)/(15×14×13) = 630/2730

Simplifying: 630/2730 = 21/91 = 3/13

**Answer: 3/13**

### Part (e) [4 marks]
**P(at least 2 strawberry | none orange).**

### Solution:
Given none orange, we're choosing from 10 chocolates (3 lemon, 7 strawberry).

P(at least 2 strawberry | none orange) = P(exactly 2 strawberry | none orange) + P(exactly 3 strawberry | none orange)

P(exactly 2 strawberry | none orange):
- Choose 2 from 7 strawberry, 1 from 3 lemon
- P = (⁷C₂ × ³C₁)/(¹⁰C₃) = (21×3)/120 = 63/120

P(exactly 3 strawberry | none orange):
- Choose 3 from 7 strawberry
- P = ⁷C₃/¹⁰C₃ = 35/120

P(at least 2 strawberry | none orange) = 63/120 + 35/120 = 98/120 = 49/60

**Answer: 49/60**
