## Question 2: Descriptive Statistics with Outliers

**Context**: Twenty children estimated the height of a tree. Their estimates (in metres) were:
4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, 5.0, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.8, 6.0, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.6, 6.8, 6.9, 19.4

### Part (a): Find the mean

**Problem**: Calculate the mean of the estimated heights.

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Sum all the values
Sum = 4.1 + 4.2 + 4.4 + 4.5 + 4.6 + 4.8 + 5.0 + 5.2 + 5.3 + 5.4 + 5.5 + 5.8 + 6.0 + 6.2 + 6.3 + 6.4 + 6.6 + 6.8 + 6.9 + 19.4

Sum = 123.4

**Step 2**: Calculate the mean
Mean = Sum ÷ Number of values = 123.4 ÷ 20 = **6.17 metres**

### Part (b): Find the median

**Problem**: Calculate the median of the estimated heights.

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: The data is already ordered from smallest to largest

**Step 2**: Find the middle values
For 20 values, the median is the average of the 10th and 11th values.
- 10th value = 5.4
- 11th value = 5.5

**Step 3**: Calculate the median
Median = (5.4 + 5.5) ÷ 2 = 10.9 ÷ 2 = **5.45 metres**

### Part (c): Comparison of mean and median

**Problem**: Give a reason why the median is more suitable than the mean as a measure of central tendency.

**Solution**:

The median is more suitable because **the mean is unduly influenced by an extreme value, 19.4**.

**Explanation**: The value 19.4 is clearly an outlier - it's much larger than all other estimates. This extreme value pulls the mean upward to 6.17m, while the median of 5.45m better represents the typical estimate made by the children.

## Question 7: Combinatorics - Arrangements and Selections

**Context**: A group of 15 friends visit an adventure park consisting of four families:
- Mr and Mrs Kenny and their four children (6 people)
- Mr and Mrs Lizo and their three children (5 people)
- Mrs Martin and her child (2 people)  
- Mr and Mrs Nantes (2 people)

### Part (a): Dividing into cars

**Problem**: The remaining 12 members (after drivers) are divided between three cars containing 5, 4, and 3 people respectively. Find the number of ways.

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Identify what needs to be arranged
After the 3 drivers (Mr Lizo, Mrs Martin, Mr Nantes), we have 12 people to divide into groups of 5, 4, and 3.

**Step 2**: Use combinations for unordered groups
Number of ways = C(12,5) × C(7,4) × C(3,3)

**Step 3**: Calculate
- C(12,5) = 12!/(5! × 7!) = 792
- C(7,4) = 7!/(4! × 3!) = 35  
- C(3,3) = 1

**Step 4**: Final calculation
Total ways = 792 × 35 × 1 = **27,720**

### Part (b): Walking through gate

**Problem**: Find the number of orders for 15 friends to go through the gate if Mr Lizo goes first and each family stays together.

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Fix Mr Lizo as first

**Step 2**: Arrange the families as units
We have 4 family units to arrange: Kenny family (6 people), remaining Lizo family (4 people), Martin family (2 people), Nantes family (2 people)

Number of ways to arrange these 4 family units = 3! = 6 (since Lizo goes first, we arrange the other 3)

**Step 3**: Arrange people within each family
- Kenny family: 6! ways
- Remaining Lizo family: 4! ways  
- Martin family: 2! ways
- Nantes family: 2! ways

**Step 4**: Calculate total
Total = 3! × 6! × 4! × 2! × 2! = 6 × 720 × 24 × 2 × 2 = **414,720**

### Part (c): Team selection with constraints

**Problem**: Choose a team of 4 adults and 3 children where the 3 children are all from different families.

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Count available people
- Adults: Mr Kenny, Mrs Kenny, Mr Lizo, Mrs Lizo, Mrs Martin, Mr Nantes, Mrs Nantes = 7 adults
- Children by family: Kenny (4), Lizo (3), Martin (1) = 8 children total

**Step 2**: Select 4 adults from 7
Number of ways = C(7,4) = 35

**Step 3**: Select 3 children from different families
- 1 child from Kenny family: C(4,1) = 4 ways
- 1 child from Lizo family: C(3,1) = 3 ways  
- 1 child from Martin family: C(1,1) = 1 way

**Step 4**: Calculate total
Total = C(7,4) × C(4,1) × C(3,1) × C(1,1) = 35 × 4 × 3 × 1 = **420**

### Part (d): Team selection with specific adults

**Problem**: Choose the team so that at least one of Mr Kenny or Mr Lizo is included.

**Solution**:

**Method 1**: Direct counting
**Case 1**: Mr Kenny included, Mr Lizo not included
- Select 3 more adults from remaining 5: C(5,3) = 10
- Select 3 children from 8: C(8,3) = 56
- Subtotal: 10 × 56 = 560

**Case 2**: Mr Lizo included, Mr Kenny not included  
- Select 3 more adults from remaining 5: C(5,3) = 10
- Select 3 children from 8: C(8,3) = 56
- Subtotal: 10 × 56 = 560

**Case 3**: Both Mr Kenny and Mr Lizo included
- Select 2 more adults from remaining 5: C(5,2) = 10  
- Select 3 children from 8: C(8,3) = 56
- Subtotal: 10 × 56 = 560

**Total**: 560 + 560 + 560 = **1,680**

**Method 2**: Complementary counting (verification)
- Total ways to select team: C(7,4) × C(8,3) = 35 × 56 = 1,960
- Ways with neither Mr Kenny nor Mr Lizo: C(5,4) × C(8,3) = 5 × 56 = 280
- Ways with at least one: 1,960 - 280 = **1,680** ✓
