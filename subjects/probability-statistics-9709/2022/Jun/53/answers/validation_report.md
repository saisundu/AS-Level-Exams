## Grade Analysis

**Performance Level:** B/A standard (84%)
- Good conceptual understanding but significant computational errors
- Strong method recognition but execution issues
- Would achieve good grade but not top tier due to calculation mistakes

---

## Conclusion

The generated solutions demonstrate good mathematical understanding with correct methodological approaches for most questions. However, multiple computational errors and some conceptual mistakes in complex combinatorics significantly impact the overall performance. The solutions require correction of calculation errors and refinement of advanced combinatorics techniques.

**Recommendation:** Solutions need correction before use as study materials.
