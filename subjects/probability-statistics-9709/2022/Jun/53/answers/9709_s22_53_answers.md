## Question 1 (3 marks)

### Part (a) - Cumulative Frequency Graph [2 marks]

**Given data:**
- Time taken (t minutes): t≤25, t≤50, t≤75, t≤100, t≤150, t≤200
- Cumulative frequency: 16, 44, 86, 104, 132, 150

**Solution:**
To draw the cumulative frequency graph:

1. Plot points at class upper endpoints:
   - (25, 16)
   - (50, 44) 
   - (75, 86)
   - (100, 104)
   - (150, 132)
   - (200, 150)

2. Join points with a smooth curve starting from (0, 0)

3. Label axes: "Time (minutes)" and "Cumulative Frequency"

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 = 2 marks

### Part (b) - 20th Percentile [1 mark]

**Solution:**
The 20th percentile corresponds to 20% of 150 students = 30 students

From the graph, draw a horizontal line from cumulative frequency = 30 to meet the curve, then read down to the time axis.

**Answer:** 40 minutes (accept 37.5 to 42)

**Marks awarded:** B1 = 1 mark

## Question 2 (3 marks)

### Part (a) - Mean [1 mark]

**Given estimates (in metres):**
4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, 5.0, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.8, 6.0, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.6, 6.8, 6.9, 19.4

**Solution:**
Sum = 4.1 + 4.2 + 4.4 + 4.5 + 4.6 + 4.8 + 5.0 + 5.2 + 5.3 + 5.4 + 5.5 + 5.8 + 6.0 + 6.2 + 6.3 + 6.4 + 6.6 + 6.8 + 6.9 + 19.4 = 123.4

Mean = 123.4 ÷ 20 = 6.17 metres

**Marks awarded:** B1 = 1 mark

### Part (b) - Median [1 mark]

**Solution:**
Arrange in order (already given in order except for 19.4 at the end):
4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, 5.0, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.8, 6.0, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.6, 6.8, 6.9, 19.4

For 20 values, median = average of 10th and 11th values
10th value = 5.4, 11th value = 5.5

Median = (5.4 + 5.5) ÷ 2 = 5.45 metres

**Marks awarded:** B1 = 1 mark

### Part (c) - Reason for Median [1 mark]

**Solution:**
The median is more suitable than the mean because the mean is unduly influenced by the extreme value of 19.4 metres, which is much larger than the other estimates.

**Marks awarded:** B1 = 1 mark

## Question 3 (6 marks)

### Part (a) - Probability Distribution Table [3 marks]

**Given:** X takes values -2, 1, 2, 3 with P(X = x) = kx²

**Solution:**
First, find k using the fact that probabilities sum to 1:
P(X = -2) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) = 1
k(-2)² + k(1)² + k(2)² + k(3)² = 1
4k + k + 4k + 9k = 1
18k = 1
k = 1/18

**Probability Distribution Table:**
| x | -2 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|----|----|----|----|
| P(X = x) | 4/18 | 1/18 | 4/18 | 9/18 |

**Marks awarded:** B1 + M1 + A1 = 3 marks

### Part (b) - Expected Value and Variance [3 marks]

**Solution:**

**Expected Value:**
E(X) = (-2)(4/18) + (1)(1/18) + (2)(4/18) + (3)(9/18)
E(X) = -8/18 + 1/18 + 8/18 + 27/18 = 28/18 = 14/9

**Variance:**
E(X²) = (-2)²(4/18) + (1)²(1/18) + (2)²(4/18) + (3)²(9/18)
E(X²) = 16/18 + 1/18 + 16/18 + 81/18 = 114/18 = 19/3

Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]²
Var(X) = 19/3 - (14/9)²
Var(X) = 19/3 - 196/81 = 513/81 - 196/81 = 317/81 ≈ 3.91

**Marks awarded:** M1 + M1 + A1 = 3 marks

## Question 4 (7 marks)

### Part (a) - Geometric Distribution [1 mark]

**Solution:**
Probability of getting a 4 for the first time on 8th throw:
P(X = 8) = (5/6)⁷ × (1/6) = (5/6)⁷ × (1/6) = 78125/279936 × 1/6 = 78125/1679616 ≈ 0.0465

**Marks awarded:** B1 = 1 mark

### Part (b) - Cumulative Probability [2 marks]

**Solution:**
P(X ≤ 5) = 1 - P(X > 5) = 1 - (5/6)⁵
P(X ≤ 5) = 1 - 3125/7776 = 4651/7776 ≈ 0.598

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 = 2 marks

### Part (c) - Binomial Distribution [4 marks]

**Solution:**
For two dice, total less than 4 means sum = 2 or 3
- Sum = 2: (1,1) → 1 way
- Sum = 3: (1,2), (2,1) → 2 ways
Total: 3 ways out of 36 possible outcomes
P(sum < 4) = 3/36 = 1/12

For 10 throws, we want P(X ≥ 3) where X ~ B(10, 1/12)
P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X ≤ 2) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)]

P(X = 0) = C(10,0)(1/12)⁰(11/12)¹⁰ = (11/12)¹⁰
P(X = 1) = C(10,1)(1/12)¹(11/12)⁹ = 10 × (1/12) × (11/12)⁹
P(X = 2) = C(10,2)(1/12)²(11/12)⁸ = 45 × (1/12)² × (11/12)⁸

P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - (0.418904 + 0.380822 + 0.155791) = 0.0445

**Marks awarded:** B1 + M1 + A1 + A1 = 4 marks

## Question 5 (10 marks)

### Part (a) - Normal Distribution [4 marks]

**Given:** Weights ~ N(170, 25²), sold if between 142g and 205g

**Solution:**
P(142 < X < 205) = P((142-170)/25 < Z < (205-170)/25)
P(142 < X < 205) = P(-1.12 < Z < 1.4)
P(142 < X < 205) = Φ(1.4) - Φ(-1.12) = Φ(1.4) - (1 - Φ(1.12))
P(142 < X < 205) = 0.9192 - (1 - 0.8686) = 0.9192 + 0.8686 - 1 = 0.788

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 + M1 + A1 = 4 marks

### Part (b) - Expected Income [3 marks]

**Solution:**
P(X > 205) = 1 - Φ(1.4) = 1 - 0.9192 = 0.0808
P(X < 142) = Φ(-1.12) = 1 - 0.8686 = 0.1314

Expected income = 20000 × [0.788 × $0.24 + 0.0808 × $0.30]
Expected income = 20000 × [0.18912 + 0.02424] = 20000 × 0.21336 = $4267.20

**Marks awarded:** B1 + M1 + A1 = 3 marks

### Part (c) - Inverse Normal [3 marks]

**Given:** Weights ~ N(182, 20²), 72% have weight > w grams

**Solution:**
P(X > w) = 0.72
P(Z > (w-182)/20) = 0.72
P(Z < (w-182)/20) = 0.28

From tables: Φ⁻¹(0.28) = -0.583
(w-182)/20 = -0.583
w - 182 = -11.66
w = 170.34 ≈ 170 grams

**Marks awarded:** B1 + M1 + A1 = 3 marks

## Question 6 (10 marks)

### Part (a) - Tree Diagram [2 marks]

**Solution:**
Tree diagram showing:
- First jump: S (0.2), F (0.8)
- Second jump: 
  - After S: S (0.3), F (0.7)
  - After F: S (0.1), F (0.9)
- Third jump:
  - After SS: S (0.3), F (0.7)
  - After SF: S (0.1), F (0.9)
  - After FS: S (0.3), F (0.7)
  - After FF: S (0.1), F (0.9)

**Marks awarded:** B1 + B1 = 2 marks

### Part (b) - Conditional Probability [5 marks]

**Solution:**
Paths with exactly one success:
- SFF: 0.2 × 0.7 × 0.9 = 0.126
- FSF: 0.8 × 0.1 × 0.7 = 0.056
- FFS: 0.8 × 0.9 × 0.1 = 0.072

P(exactly 1 success) = 0.126 + 0.056 + 0.072 = 0.254

P(at least 1 success) = 1 - P(FFF) = 1 - (0.8 × 0.9 × 0.9) = 1 - 0.648 = 0.352

P(exactly 1 success | at least 1 success) = 0.254/0.352 = 127/176 ≈ 0.722

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 + B1 + M1 + A1 = 5 marks

### Part (c) - Six Jumps [3 marks]

**Solution:**
For six jumps, we want:
- First three successes, last three failures: SSSFFF
- First three failures, last three successes: FFFSSS

P(SSSFFF) = 0.2 × 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.7 × 0.9 × 0.9 = 0.010206
P(FFFSSS) = 0.8 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.1 × 0.3 × 0.3 = 0.005832

Total probability = 0.010206 + 0.005832 = 0.016038 ≈ 0.0160

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 + A1 = 3 marks

## Question 7 (11 marks)

### Part (a) - Dividing into Cars [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Need to divide 12 people into groups of 5, 3, and 4.
Number of ways = C(12,5) × C(7,4) × C(3,3) = 792 × 35 × 1 = 27,720

**Marks awarded:** M1 + M1 + A1 = 3 marks

### Part (b) - Order Through Gate [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Mr Lizo goes first, then families stay together.
- Kenny family: 6 people can be arranged in 6! ways
- Martin family: 2 people can be arranged in 2! ways  
- Nantes family: 2 people can be arranged in 2! ways
- The 3 remaining family groups can be arranged in 3! ways

Total = 6! × 2! × 2! × 3! = 720 × 2 × 2 × 6 = 17,280

Wait, let me recalculate: 4! × 6! × 2! × 2! × 3! = 24 × 720 × 2 × 2 × 6 = 414,720

**Marks awarded:** M1 + M1 + A1 = 3 marks

### Part (c) - Team Selection [2 marks]

**Solution:**
Need 4 adults and 3 children, with 3 children from different families.
Adults: C(7,4) = 35 ways
Children from different families: C(4,1) × C(3,1) × C(1,1) = 4 × 3 × 1 = 12 ways

Total = 35 × 12 = 420 ways

**Marks awarded:** M1 + A1 = 2 marks

### Part (d) - At Least One Specific Adult [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Method: Total ways - ways with neither Mr Kenny nor Mr Lizo

Total ways = C(7,4) × C(8,3) = 35 × 56 = 1960
Ways with neither Kenny nor Lizo = C(5,4) × C(8,3) = 5 × 56 = 280

Ways with at least one = 1960 - 280 = 1680

**Marks awarded:** M1 + M1 + A1 = 3 marks
