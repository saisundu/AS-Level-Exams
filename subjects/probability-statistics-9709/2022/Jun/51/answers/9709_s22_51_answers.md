## Question 1 [6 marks total]
**DECEIVED has 8 letters: D(2), E(3), C(1), I(1), V(1).**

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Find arrangements where all 3 Es are together and 2 Ds are together.**

### Solution:
Treat the 3 Es as one unit (EEE) and the 2 Ds as one unit (DD).
We now have 5 units to arrange: (EEE), (DD), C, I, V

Number of arrangements = 5! = 120

**Answer: 120**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: k! where k = 5, 6 or 7
✓ A1: 120

### Part (b) [4 marks]
**Find arrangements where the 3 Es are not all together.**

### Solution:
Total arrangements of DECEIVED = 8!/(2! × 3!) = 40320/12 = 3360

Arrangements with 3 Es together:
Treat EEE as one unit. Arrange 6 objects: (EEE), D, D, C, I, V
Number = 6!/2! = 720/2 = 360

Arrangements with 3 Es NOT all together = 3360 - 360 = 3000

**Answer: 3000**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: 8!/(2! × 3!) for total arrangements
✓ M1: 6!/2! seen in subtraction
✓ M1: 8!/(2! × 3!) - 6!/2! structure
✓ A1: 3000

✓ A1: 990

### Part (b) [4 marks]
**Find ways with Mrs Lan on committee and more women than men.**

### Solution:
Mrs Lan must be on committee. Need to choose 4 more from remaining 13 people (7 women, 6 men).
For more women than men on committee:

Case 1: 3W + 2M (total: 3W + 2M + Mrs Lan = 4W + 2M)
Ways = ⁷C₂ × ⁶C₂ = 21 × 15 = 315

Case 2: 4W + 1M (total: 4W + 1M + Mrs Lan = 5W + 1M)
Ways = ⁷C₃ × ⁶C₁ = 35 × 6 = 210

Case 3: 5W + 0M (total: 5W + 0M + Mrs Lan = 6W + 0M)
Ways = ⁷C₄ × ⁶C₀ = 35 × 1 = 35

Total = 315 + 210 + 35 = 560

**Answer: 560**

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Calculate estimate of standard deviation. (Mean = 31.44 given)**

### Solution:
Using midpoints: 10, 25, 35, 50, 75

Variance = Σfx²/Σf - (mean)²

Σfx² = 440×10² + 720×25² + 920×35² + 300×50² + 120×75²
     = 44000 + 450000 + 1127000 + 750000 + 675000
     = 3046000

Variance = 3046000/2500 - (31.44)²
         = 1218.4 - 988.4736 = 229.9264

Standard deviation = √229.9264 = 15.2

**Answer: 15.2**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: At least 4 correct midpoints seen
✓ M1: Correct variance formula with midpoints and mean²
✓ A1: 15.2

## Question 4 [10 marks total]
**Jacob has 4 coins: 1 biased (P(H) = 7/10), 3 fair. X = number of heads.**

| x | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P(X=x) | 3/80 | a | b | c | 7/80 |

### Part (a) [4 marks]
**Show a = 1/5 and find b, c.**

### Solution:
P(X = 1) = P(biased shows T, exactly 1 fair shows H) + P(biased shows H, all fair show T)
         = (3/10) × ³C₁ × (1/2)¹ × (1/2)² + (7/10) × (1/2)³
         = (3/10) × 3 × (1/8) + (7/10) × (1/8)
         = 9/80 + 7/80 = 16/80 = 1/5

So a = 1/5 ✓

P(X = 2) = P(biased shows T, exactly 2 fair show H) + P(biased shows H, exactly 1 fair shows H)
         = (3/10) × ³C₂ × (1/2)² × (1/2)¹ + (7/10) × ³C₁ × (1/2)¹ × (1/2)²
         = (3/10) × 3 × (1/8) + (7/10) × 3 × (1/8)
         = 9/80 + 21/80 = 30/80 = 3/8

So b = 3/8

P(X = 3) = P(biased shows T, all 3 fair show H) + P(biased shows H, exactly 2 fair show H)
         = (3/10) × (1/2)³ + (7/10) × ³C₂ × (1/2)² × (1/2)¹
         = (3/10) × (1/8) + (7/10) × 3 × (1/8)
         = 3/80 + 21/80 = 24/80 = 3/10

So c = 3/10

**Answer: a = 1/5, b = 3/8, c = 3/10**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: Clear statement showing a = 1/5
✓ M1: Clear calculation for either b or c
✓ A1: Either b or c correct
✓ B1: b + c = 27/40

### Part (b) [1 mark]
**Find E(X).**

### Solution:
E(X) = 0×(3/80) + 1×(1/5) + 2×(3/8) + 3×(3/10) + 4×(7/80)
     = 0 + 16/80 + 30/80 + 24/80 + 7/80
     = 77/80 = 2.2

**Answer: E(X) = 2.2**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: Correct calculation using their values = 2.2

### Part (c) [3 marks]
**Jacob throws 4 coins 10 times. Find P(exactly 1 head on fewer than 3 occasions).**

### Solution:
P(exactly 1 head) = 1/5 = 0.2

Let Y = number of times exactly 1 head occurs in 10 throws
Y ~ B(10, 0.2)

P(Y < 3) = P(Y = 0) + P(Y = 1) + P(Y = 2)

P(Y = 0) = ¹⁰C₀ × (0.2)⁰ × (0.8)¹⁰ = 0.107374
P(Y = 1) = ¹⁰C₁ × (0.2)¹ × (0.8)⁹ = 0.268435
P(Y = 2) = ¹⁰C₂ × (0.2)² × (0.8)⁸ = 0.301989

P(Y < 3) = 0.107374 + 0.268435 + 0.301989 = 0.678

**Answer: 0.678**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: One term ¹⁰Cₓ × pˣ × (1-p)¹⁰⁻ˣ for 0 < x < 10, 0 < p < 1
✓ A1: Correct expression
✓ B1: 0.677 < p ≤ 0.678

### Part (d) [2 marks]
**Find P(exactly 1 head for first time on 7th or 8th throw).**

### Solution:
This is a geometric distribution with p = 0.2.

P(first success on 7th throw) = (0.8)⁶ × 0.2 = 0.0524288
P(first success on 8th throw) = (0.8)⁷ × 0.2 = 0.041943

P(first success on 7th or 8th throw) = 0.0524288 + 0.041943 = 0.0944

**Answer: 0.0944**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: (1-p)ˡ⁻¹ × p for l = 6, 7 and m = l + 1, 0 < p < 1
✓ A1: 0.09437 ≤ p ≤ 0.0944

## Question 5 [11 marks total]
**Leaf lengths modeled by normal distributions.**

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Type 1: N(5.2, 1.5²). Find P(length < 6cm).**

### Solution:
Let X ~ N(5.2, 1.5²)

P(X < 6) = P(Z < (6-5.2)/1.5) = P(Z < 0.533) = Φ(0.533) = 0.703

**Answer: 0.703**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: 6, 5.2, 1.5 substituted into standardisation formula
✓ A1: 0.703

### Part (b) [5 marks]
**Type 2: 500 leaves, 46 < 3cm, 95 > 8cm. Find mean and standard deviation.**

### Solution:
Let Y ~ N(μ, σ²)

P(Y < 3) = 46/500 = 0.092
P(Y > 8) = 95/500 = 0.19

From normal tables:
P(Z < -1.329) = 0.092, so (3-μ)/σ = -1.329
P(Z > 0.878) = 0.19, so (8-μ)/σ = 0.878

From the equations:
3 - μ = -1.329σ  →  μ = 3 + 1.329σ
8 - μ = 0.878σ   →  μ = 8 - 0.878σ

Setting equal: 3 + 1.329σ = 8 - 0.878σ
2.207σ = 5
σ = 2.27

μ = 3 + 1.329 × 2.27 = 3 + 3.017 = 6.01

**Answer: μ = 6.01, σ = 2.27**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: 1.328 < z₁ ≤ 1.329 or -1.329 ≤ z₁ < -1.328
✓ B1: 0.877 < z₂ ≤ 0.878 or -0.878 ≤ z₂ < -0.877
✓ M1: Use of standardisation formula with μ, σ, z-value and 3 or 8
✓ M1: Use elimination or substitution method to solve equations
✓ A1: 2.26 ≤ σ ≤ 2.27, 6.01 ≤ μ ≤ 6.02

### Part (c) [4 marks]
**In sample of 2000 leaves, how many more than 1 standard deviation from mean?**

### Solution:
More than 1 standard deviation from mean means |Z| > 1.

P(|Z| > 1) = P(Z < -1) + P(Z > 1)
           = Φ(-1) + (1 - Φ(1))
           = (1 - Φ(1)) + (1 - Φ(1))
           = 2(1 - Φ(1))
           = 2(1 - 0.8413) = 2 × 0.1587 = 0.3174

Number of leaves = 2000 × 0.3174 = 634.8 ≈ 635

**Answer: 635**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: Identify 1 and -1 as appropriate z-values
✓ M1: Calculate appropriate area from phis of ±1
✓ A1: AWRT 0.317
✓ B1: FT their probability, final answer positive integer

## Question 6 [8 marks total]
**Janice's computer game with Level 1 and Level 2.**

Level 1: P(complete on 1st attempt) = 0.6, P(complete on 2nd attempt | fail 1st) = 0.3
Level 2: P(complete on 1st attempt) = 0.4, P(complete on 2nd attempt | fail 1st) = 0.2

### Part (a) [1 mark]
**Show P(moves to Level 2) = 0.72.**

### Solution:
P(completes Level 1) = P(1st attempt) + P(fails 1st) × P(2nd attempt)
                     = 0.6 + 0.4 × 0.3 = 0.6 + 0.12 = 0.72 ✓

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: Clear identified calculation = 0.72

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Find P(finishes game).**

### Solution:
P(finishes game) = P(completes Level 1) × P(completes Level 2)
                 = 0.72 × [0.4 + 0.6 × 0.2]
                 = 0.72 × [0.4 + 0.12]
                 = 0.72 × 0.52 = 0.3744

**Answer: 0.3744**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: 0.72 × u, 0 < u < 1
✓ M1: v × (0.4 + 0.6 × 0.2) or v × (1 - 0.6 × 0.8), 0 < v ≤ 1
✓ A1: 0.3744

### Part (c) [4 marks]
**Find P(fails exactly one attempt | finishes game).**

### Solution:
P(fails exactly 1 attempt | finishes game) = P(fails exactly 1 attempt ∩ finishes game) / P(finishes game)

Scenarios where exactly 1 attempt fails and game is finished:
1. Fails Level 1 first attempt, passes Level 1 second attempt, passes Level 2 first attempt
   P = 0.4 × 0.3 × 0.4 = 0.048

2. Passes Level 1 first attempt, fails Level 2 first attempt, passes Level 2 second attempt
   P = 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.2 = 0.072

P(fails exactly 1 attempt ∩ finishes game) = 0.048 + 0.072 = 0.12

P(fails exactly 1 attempt | finishes game) = 0.12/0.3744 = 0.321

**Answer: 0.321**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: Either 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.2 or 0.4 × 0.3 × 0.4 seen
✓ A1: Both correct, no additional terms
✓ M1: Sum of two 3-term probabilities as numerator / their (b)
✓ A1: 0.3205 < p ≤ 0.321
