## Question 1 (6 marks)

### Part (a) - Show P(X = 2) = 3/20 [1 mark]

**Solution:**
Three biased coins with P(H) = 1/3, 1/4, 1/5 respectively.

For exactly 2 heads, we need exactly 2 coins to show heads and 1 to show tails.

**Possible combinations:**
- Coin 1 (H), Coin 2 (H), Coin 3 (T): (1/3) × (1/4) × (4/5) = 4/60 = 1/15
- Coin 1 (H), Coin 2 (T), Coin 3 (H): (1/3) × (3/4) × (1/5) = 3/60 = 1/20  
- Coin 1 (T), Coin 2 (H), Coin 3 (H): (2/3) × (1/4) × (1/5) = 2/60 = 1/30

P(X = 2) = 1/15 + 1/20 + 1/30 = 4/60 + 3/60 + 2/60 = 9/60 = 3/20 ✓

**Marks awarded:** 1 mark

### Part (b) - Probability Distribution Table [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Calculate all possible outcomes:

**P(X = 0):** All tails
P(X = 0) = (2/3) × (3/4) × (4/5) = 24/60 = 2/5

**P(X = 1):** Exactly one head
- H,T,T: (1/3) × (3/4) × (4/5) = 12/60 = 1/5
- T,H,T: (2/3) × (1/4) × (4/5) = 8/60 = 2/15
- T,T,H: (2/3) × (3/4) × (1/5) = 6/60 = 1/10
P(X = 1) = 1/5 + 2/15 + 1/10 = 6/30 + 4/30 + 3/30 = 13/30

**P(X = 2):** From part (a) = 3/20

**P(X = 3):** All heads
P(X = 3) = (1/3) × (1/4) × (1/5) = 1/60

**Complete table:**
| X | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P(X=x) | 2/5 | 13/30 | 3/20 | 1/60 |

**Verification:** 2/5 + 13/30 + 3/20 + 1/60 = 24/60 + 26/60 + 9/60 + 1/60 = 60/60 = 1 ✓

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

### Part (c) - Variance [2 marks]

**Given:** E(X) = 47/60

**Solution:**
E(X²) = 0²(2/5) + 1²(13/30) + 2²(3/20) + 3²(1/60)
= 0 + 13/30 + 12/20 + 9/60
= 0 + 26/60 + 36/60 + 9/60 = 71/60

Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]²
= 71/60 - (47/60)²
= 71/60 - 2209/3600
= 4260/3600 - 2209/3600 = 2051/3600

**Answer:** Var(X) = 2051/3600

## Question 2 (9 marks)

### Part (a) - Multinomial Probability [1 mark]

**Solution:**
P(F) = 0.55, P(G) = 0.30, P(H) = 0.15

P(all different companies) = 3! × P(F) × P(G) × P(H)
= 6 × 0.55 × 0.30 × 0.15 = 6 × 0.0247 = 0.1485

**Answer:** 0.149

**Marks awarded:** 1 mark

### Part (b) - Binomial Distribution [3 marks]

**Solution:**
X ~ B(12, 0.55) where X = number buying from company F

P(X < 10) = P(X ≤ 9) = 1 - P(X ≥ 10) = 1 - [P(X = 10) + P(X = 11) + P(X = 12)]

P(X = 10) = C(12,10) × (0.55)¹⁰ × (0.45)² = 66 × 0.0025 × 0.2025 = 0.0334
P(X = 11) = C(12,11) × (0.55)¹¹ × (0.45)¹ = 12 × 0.0014 × 0.45 = 0.0075
P(X = 12) = (0.55)¹² = 0.0008

P(X < 10) = 1 - (0.0334 + 0.0075 + 0.0008) = 1 - 0.0417 = 0.958

**Answer:** 0.958

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

### Part (c) - Normal Approximation to Binomial [5 marks]

**Solution:**
Y ~ B(140, 0.15) where Y = number buying from company H

Mean μ = np = 140 × 0.15 = 21
Variance σ² = np(1-p) = 140 × 0.15 × 0.85 = 17.85
Standard deviation σ = √17.85 = 4.225

Using normal approximation with continuity correction:
P(Y > 24) = P(Y ≥ 24.5)

Standardizing: Z = (24.5 - 21)/4.225 = 3.5/4.225 = 0.829

P(Z ≥ 0.829) = 1 - Φ(0.829) = 1 - 0.7967 = 0.203

**Answer:** 0.203

## Question 3 (9 marks)

### Part (a) - Cumulative Frequency Graph [4 marks]

**Solution:**
First, calculate cumulative frequencies:

| Length (cm) | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| 5-9         | 18        | 18                  |
| 10-14       | 28        | 46                  |
| 15-19       | 60        | 106                 |
| 20-24       | 72        | 178                 |
| 25-29       | 48        | 226                 |
| 30-39       | 24        | 250                 |

Plot points at upper class boundaries: (9.5, 18), (14.5, 46), (19.5, 106), (24.5, 178), (29.5, 226), (39.5, 250)

Join with smooth curve, label axes appropriately.

**Marks awarded:** 4 marks

### Part (b) - Using Graph to Find k [2 marks]

**Solution:**
38% of 250 leaves = 95 leaves

If 38% are of length k cm or more, then 62% are less than k cm.
62% of 250 = 155 leaves

From graph, draw horizontal line from cf = 155 to meet curve, then read down to length axis.

**Answer:** k ≈ 22.5 cm

**Marks awarded:** 2 marks

### Part (c) - Estimated Mean [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Using midpoints of each class:

| Class | Midpoint | Frequency | fx |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----|
| 5-9   | 7        | 18        | 126 |
| 10-14 | 12       | 28        | 336 |
| 15-19 | 17       | 60        | 1020|
| 20-24 | 22       | 72        | 1584|
| 25-29 | 27       | 48        | 1296|
| 30-39 | 34.5     | 24        | 828 |

Mean = Σfx/Σf = (126 + 336 + 1020 + 1584 + 1296 + 828)/250 = 5190/250 = 20.76 cm

**Answer:** 20.8 cm

## Question 4 (7 marks)

### Part (a) - Same Colour Probability [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Total ways to select 3 cars = C(16,3) = 560

**All white:** C(8,3) = 56
**All black:** C(5,3) = 10  
**All silver:** C(3,3) = 1

P(all same colour) = (56 + 10 + 1)/560 = 67/560

**Answer:** 67/560 = 0.120

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

### Part (b) - At Least One White and One Black [4 marks]

**Solution:**
Use complementary counting:

Total ways = C(16,3) = 560

**Subtract cases without white or without black:**
- No white cars (only black and silver): C(8,3) = 56
- No black cars (only white and silver): C(11,3) = 165
- No white AND no black (only silver): C(3,3) = 1

Using inclusion-exclusion:
Ways without white OR without black = 56 + 165 - 1 = 220

Ways with at least one white AND at least one black = 560 - 220 = 340

P(at least one white and one black) = 340/560 = 17/28

**Answer:** 17/28 = 0.607

**Marks awarded:** 4 marks

## Question 5 (9 marks)

### Part (a) - Normal Distribution [3 marks]

**Given:** X ~ N(65.8, 9.6²)

**Solution:**
P(56 < X < 75) = P((56-65.8)/9.6 < Z < (75-65.8)/9.6)
= P(-1.021 < Z < 0.958)
= Φ(0.958) - Φ(-1.021)
= 0.831 - (1 - 0.846) = 0.831 - 0.154 = 0.677

**Answer:** 0.677

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

### Part (b) - Parameter Estimation [3 marks]

**Given:** Y ~ N(72.4, v²), P(Y < 59.1) = 0.10

**Solution:**
P(Y < 59.1) = 0.10
P(Z < (59.1-72.4)/v) = 0.10

From normal tables: Φ⁻¹(0.10) = -1.282

(59.1-72.4)/v = -1.282
-13.3/v = -1.282
v = 13.3/1.282 = 10.4

**Answer:** v = 10.4

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

### Part (c) - Geometric Distribution [1 mark]

**Solution:**
P(first occurrence on 5th day) = (0.9)⁴ × 0.1 = 0.6561 × 0.1 = 0.0656

**Answer:** 0.0656

**Marks awarded:** 1 mark

### Part (d) - Geometric Distribution [2 marks]

**Solution:**
P(first occurrence before 5th day) = P(occurs on day 1, 2, 3, or 4)
= 1 - P(doesn't occur in first 4 days)
= 1 - (0.9)⁴ = 1 - 0.6561 = 0.344

**Answer:** 0.344

## Question 6 (10 marks)

### Part (a) - Basic Arrangements [1 mark]

**Solution:**
Books: 3 blue, 2 red, 2 yellow, 1 orange, 1 purple, 1 green

Total arrangements = 10!/(3! × 2! × 2! × 1! × 1! × 1!) = 3,628,800/(6 × 2 × 2) = 151,200

**Answer:** 151,200

**Marks awarded:** 1 mark

### Part (b) - Constrained Arrangements [2 marks]

**Solution:**
**Step 1:** Blue books together
Treat BBB as one unit: (BBB), R, R, Y, Y, O, P, G = 8 units with 2 Rs and 2 Ys
Arrangements with blues together = 8!/(2! × 2!) = 10,080

**Step 2:** Subtract cases where blues together AND yellows together
Treat BBB and YY as units: (BBB), (YY), R, R, O, P, G = 6 units with 2 Rs
Arrangements = 6!/2! = 360

**Answer:** 10,080 - 360 = 9,720

**Marks awarded:** 2 marks

### Part (c) - Exactly 4 Books Between Yellows [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Pattern: Y _ _ _ _ Y _ _ _ _

**Step 1:** Place yellows with 4 books between
In 10 positions, this gives us patterns: Y(1) _ _ _ _ Y(6), Y(2) _ _ _ _ Y(7), Y(3) _ _ _ _ Y(8), Y(4) _ _ _ _ Y(9), Y(5) _ _ _ _ Y(10)
= 5 ways to place the yellows

**Step 2:** Arrange remaining 8 books in 8 positions
Books: 3 blue, 2 red, 1 orange, 1 purple, 1 green
Arrangements = 8!/(3! × 2!) = 3,360

**Answer:** 5 × 3,360 = 16,800

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

### Part (d) - Selection with Constraints [4 marks]

**Solution:**
Constraints: At least 1 red, at most 1 blue, exactly 1 yellow

**Case 1: 1 red, 0 blue, 1 yellow, 2 others**
C(2,1) × C(3,0) × C(2,1) × C(3,2) = 2 × 1 × 2 × 3 = 12

**Case 2: 1 red, 1 blue, 1 yellow, 1 other**
C(2,1) × C(3,1) × C(2,1) × C(3,1) = 2 × 3 × 2 × 3 = 36

**Case 3: 2 red, 0 blue, 1 yellow, 1 other**
C(2,2) × C(3,0) × C(2,1) × C(3,1) = 1 × 1 × 2 × 3 = 6

**Case 4: 2 red, 1 blue, 1 yellow, 0 others**
C(2,2) × C(3,1) × C(2,1) × C(3,0) = 1 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 6

**Total:** 12 + 36 + 6 + 6 = 60

**Answer:** 60
