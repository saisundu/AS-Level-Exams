- **Mark Scheme:** Answer should be 2051/3600 ≈ 0.570
- **Solution Error:** Calculation method correct but depends on corrected probabilities

### Question 2: Binomial and Normal Approximation ❌ PARTIALLY INCORRECT
**Marks Achieved:** 7/9

**Part (a) - Multinomial Probability [1/1]**

**Part (b) - Complex Probability [2/4]**
- ❌ **Critical Error:** Incorrect approach and calculation
- **Mark Scheme:** Answer should be 17/28 ≈ 0.607
- **Solution Error:** Used inclusion-exclusion incorrectly
- **Issue:** The calculation 560 - 220 = 340 is wrong; should be different approach

### Question 5: Normal Distribution Applications ✅ CORRECT

## Summary of Required Corrections

### Priority 1: Question 1 Part (b) - Probability Distribution
- **Recalculate P(X = 1):** Verify individual scenario calculations
- **Check:** H,T,T + T,H,T + T,T,H should equal 13/30
- **Verify:** All probabilities sum to 1

### Priority 2: Question 1 Part (c) - Variance
- **Recalculate:** Using corrected probability distribution
- **Expected Answer:** 2051/3600 ≈ 0.570

### Priority 3: Question 2 Part (c) - Normal Approximation
- **Check Calculation:** Z = (24.5-21)/√17.85 = 0.8284
- **Correct Answer:** Should be 0.204 (not 0.203)
- **Verify:** P(Z ≥ 0.8284) = 1 - 0.7961 = 0.204

### Priority 4: Question 4 Part (b) - Hypergeometric Probability
- **Correct Approach:** Use proper case analysis for "at least one white AND at least one black"

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action Required:** Correct Questions 1, 2, and 4 to achieve full marks
2. **Probability Verification:** Double-check all probability calculations sum to 1
3. **Normal Distribution:** Verify standardization and table lookup accuracy
4. **Hypergeometric Problems:** Use systematic case analysis for complex constraints

**Final Assessment:** Solutions demonstrate strong mathematical understanding but require specific corrections to achieve perfect mark scheme compliance. The errors are primarily computational rather than conceptual.
