## Question 1 [3 marks]
**Rice bag masses ~ N(n, 0.14²). P(mass < 1.48) = 0.22. Find n.**

### Solution:
Let X = mass of rice bag, X ~ N(n, 0.14²)

P(X < 1.48) = 0.22

Standardizing: P(Z < (1.48 - n)/0.14) = 0.22

From normal tables: Φ(-0.772) = 0.22
So: (1.48 - n)/0.14 = -0.772

1.48 - n = -0.772 × 0.14 = -0.108
n = 1.48 + 0.108 = 1.588 ≈ 1.59

**Answer: n = 1.59 kg**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: 0.771 < z < 0.773 or -0.773 < z < -0.771 seen
✓ M1: Use of standardisation formula with μ, 1.48 and 0.14 equating to z-value

## Question 2 [7 marks total]
**KANGAROO has 8 letters: K(1), A(2), N(1), G(1), R(1), O(2).**

### Part (a) [3 marks]
**Find arrangements where As are together and Os are not together.**

### Solution:
Method: Total arrangements with As together - arrangements with As together AND Os together

Step 1: Arrangements with As together
Treat AA as one unit. Arrange 7 objects: (AA), K, N, G, R, O, O
Number = 7!/2! = 5040/2 = 2520

Step 2: Arrangements with As together AND Os together
Treat AA as one unit and OO as one unit. Arrange 6 objects: (AA), (OO), K, N, G, R
Number = 6! = 720

Step 3: As together but Os NOT together = 2520 - 720 = 1800

**Answer: 1800**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: 7! - k/2!, where k is an integer ≥ 1
✓ M1: n - 6!, where n is an integer > 720
✓ A1: 1800

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**8-sided die with faces K,A,N,G,A,R,O,O. Find P(fewer than 6 rolls to get A).**

### Solution:
P(A) = 2/8 = 1/4, P(not A) = 3/4

P(fewer than 6 rolls) = P(X < 6) = 1 - P(X ≥ 6) = 1 - (3/4)⁵

= 1 - 243/1024 = 781/1024 = 0.763

**Answer: 781/1024 = 0.763**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: 1 - (3/4)ᵃ where a = 5, 6
✓ A1: 0.7626 < p ≤ 0.763

### Part (c) [2 marks]
**Find P(second A obtained on 6th roll).**

### Solution:
For second A on 6th roll: exactly 1 A in first 5 rolls, then A on 6th roll.

P(exactly 1 A in 5 rolls) × P(A on 6th roll) = ⁵C₁ × (1/4)¹ × (3/4)⁴ × (1/4)

= 5 × (1/4) × (81/256) × (1/4) = 5 × 81/4096 = 405/4096 = 0.0989

**Answer: 405/4096 = 0.0989**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: (5/1) × p⁴ × (1-p), 0 < p < 1, p ≠ 1-p

## Question 3 [10 marks total]
**Running times data for Gulls and Herons teams.**

### Part (a) [4 marks]
**Draw back-to-back stem-and-leaf diagram with Gulls on left.**

### Solution:
First, organize the data:
Gulls: 7.9, 8.2, 8.3, 8.6, 8.6, 8.8, 9.2, 9.7, 9.8, 10.0, 10.4
Herons: 8.1, 8.3, 8.5, 8.7, 9.2, 9.3, 9.5, 9.7, 9.9, 9.9, 10.8

```

    6  6  3  2   | 8  1  3  5  7
  8  7  2        | 9  2  3  5  7  9  9
        4  0     | 10 8

Key: 7|9|5 means 9.7 seconds for Gulls and 9.5 seconds for Herons
```

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: Correct stem
✓ B1: Correct Gulls labeled on left, leaves in order
✓ B1: Correct Herons labeled on same diagram, leaves in order
✓ B1: Correct key with both clubs labeled and 'sec' or 's' stated

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Find median and IQR for Gulls.**

### Solution:
Gulls data in order: 7.9, 8.2, 8.3, 8.6, 8.6, 8.8, 9.2, 9.7, 9.8, 10.0, 10.4

For n = 11:
- Median position = (11+1)/2 = 6th value → Median = 8.8 seconds
- Lower quartile position = (11+1)/4 = 3rd value → LQ = 8.3 seconds  
- Upper quartile position = 3(11+1)/4 = 9th value → UQ = 9.8 seconds
- IQR = 9.8 - 8.3 = 1.5 seconds

**Answer: Median = 8.8 seconds, IQR = 1.5 seconds**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: Median = 8.8 (seconds)
✓ M1: 9.7 ≤ UQ ≤ 10.0, 8.2 ≤ LQ ≤ 8.6
✓ A1: 1.5

### Part (c) [2 marks]
**Eagles: 20 runners, Σx = 175.0. Swifts: 30 runners, mean = 8.4. Find mean of all 50 runners.**

### Solution:
Mean of all 50 runners = (Σx_Eagles + Σx_Swifts)/50

Σx_Eagles = 175.0
Σx_Swifts = 30 × 8.4 = 252.0

Mean = (175.0 + 252.0)/50 = 427.0/50 = 8.54

**Answer: 8.54 seconds**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: (175.0 + 30 × 8.4)/50 or (175.0 + 252.0)/50
✓ A1: 8.54

### Part (d) [3 marks]
**Given Σx² = 1823.0 for Eagles and overall standard deviation = 1.38. Find Σy².**

### Solution:
Using the formula: Variance = (Σx²)/n - (mean)²

Overall variance = (1.38)² = 1.9044

For all 50 runners:
1.9044 = (Σx² + Σy²)/50 - (8.54)²
1.9044 = (1823.0 + Σy²)/50 - 72.9316
1.9044 + 72.9316 = (1823.0 + Σy²)/50
74.836 = (1823.0 + Σy²)/50
3741.8 = 1823.0 + Σy²
Σy² = 3741.8 - 1823.0 = 1918.8

**Answer: Σy² = 1918.8**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: Substitute values into correct variance formula
✓ DM1: Rearrange equation to obtain Σy²
✓ A1: 1918.8

## Question 4 [12 marks total]
**Puzzle completion times ~ N(32.4, 2.5²) for 600 competitors.**

### Part (a) [4 marks]
**How many competitors within 1.2 minutes of mean time?**

### Solution:
Within 1.2 minutes of mean means 31.2 < X < 33.6

P(31.2 < X < 33.6) = P((31.2-32.4)/2.5 < Z < (33.6-32.4)/2.5)
                    = P(-0.48 < Z < 0.48)
                    = Φ(0.48) - Φ(-0.48)
                    = Φ(0.48) - (1 - Φ(0.48))
                    = 2Φ(0.48) - 1
                    = 2(0.6844) - 1 = 0.3688

Expected number = 0.3688 × 600 = 221.28 ≈ 221

**Answer: 221 competitors**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: Using ±standardisation formula with 32.4, 2.5 and either 31.2 or 33.6
✓ M1: Calculating correct probability area (2Φ(0.48) - 1)
✓ A1: 0.3688
✓ B1: FT their probability to obtain single integer answer (221 or 222)

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**9 competitors selected. Find P(at least 2 and fewer than 8 had times < 36.0 minutes).**

### Solution:
P(time < 36.0) = 0.6, so X ~ B(9, 0.6)

P(2 ≤ X < 8) = P(2 ≤ X ≤ 7) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) - P(X = 8) - P(X = 9)

P(X = 0) = ⁹C₀ × (0.6)⁰ × (0.4)⁹ = 0.000262144
P(X = 1) = ⁹C₁ × (0.6)¹ × (0.4)⁸ = 0.00353894
P(X = 8) = ⁹C₈ × (0.6)⁸ × (0.4)¹ = 0.060466176
P(X = 9) = ⁹C₉ × (0.6)⁹ × (0.4)⁰ = 0.010077696

P(2 ≤ X ≤ 7) = 1 - (0.000262144 + 0.00353894 + 0.060466176 + 0.010077696) = 0.926

**Answer: 0.926**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: One term ⁹Cₓ × pˣ × (1-p)⁹⁻ˣ, 0 < p < 1, x ≠ 0 or 9
✓ A1: Correct unsimplified expression
✓ B1: 0.925 < p ≤ 0.926

### Part (c) [5 marks]
**80 competitors selected. Use approximation for P(more than 50 had times < 36.0).**

### Solution:
Let Y = number with times < 36.0, Y ~ B(80, 0.6)

Using normal approximation:
μ = np = 80 × 0.6 = 48
σ² = np(1-p) = 80 × 0.6 × 0.4 = 19.2
σ = √19.2 = 4.382

With continuity correction:
P(Y > 50) = P(Y ≥ 50.5)

Standardizing: Z = (50.5 - 48)/√19.2 = 2.5/4.382 = 0.571

P(Y > 50) = P(Z > 0.571) = 1 - Φ(0.571) = 1 - 0.7160 = 0.284

**Answer: 0.284**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: 48 and 19.2 seen
✓ M1: Substituting into ±standardising formula
✓ M1: Using continuity correction 50.5
✓ M1: Appropriate probability area from final process
✓ A1: AWRT 0.284

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Show P(X = 2) = 3/7.**

### Solution:
P(X = 2) = (⁶C₂ × ⁴C₂)/¹⁰C₄ = (15 × 6)/210 = 90/210 = 3/7 ✓

✓ A1: 3/7 (Answer Given)

### Part (b) [4 marks]
**Draw probability distribution table for X.**

### Solution:
P(X = 0) = (⁶C₀ × ⁴C₄)/¹⁰C₄ = (1 × 1)/210 = 1/210
P(X = 1) = (⁶C₁ × ⁴C₃)/¹⁰C₄ = (6 × 4)/210 = 24/210 = 4/35
P(X = 2) = (⁶C₂ × ⁴C₂)/¹⁰C₄ = (15 × 6)/210 = 90/210 = 3/7
P(X = 3) = (⁶C₃ × ⁴C₁)/¹⁰C₄ = (20 × 4)/210 = 80/210 = 8/21
P(X = 4) = (⁶C₄ × ⁴C₀)/¹⁰C₄ = (15 × 1)/210 = 15/210 = 1/14

| x | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |

✓ B1: Fifth probability correct (1/14)

### Part (c) [3 marks]
**Find P(at least 2 blue | at least 1 red and at least 1 blue).**

### Solution:
P(at least 2 blue | at least 1 red and at least 1 blue) = P(X ≥ 2 ∩ mixed)/P(mixed)

Mixed outcomes (at least 1 red and at least 1 blue): X = 1, 2, 3
P(X ≥ 2 ∩ mixed) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) = 3/7 + 8/21 = 9/21 + 8/21 = 17/21

P(mixed) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) = 4/35 + 3/7 + 8/21 = 4/35 + 15/35 + 8/21 = 19/35 + 8/21 = 57/105 + 40/105 = 97/105

P(at least 2 blue | mixed) = (17/21)/(97/105) = (17/21) × (105/97) = 17 × 5/97 = 85/97 = 0.876

**Answer: 85/97 = 0.876**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: (3/7 + 8/21) seen as numerator
✓ B1: (4/35 + 3/7 + 8/21) seen as denominator
