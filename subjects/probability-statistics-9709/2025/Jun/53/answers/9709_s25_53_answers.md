## Question 1 [4 marks]
**For 40 values of x: Σ(x-k) = 836, Σ(x-k)² = 25410.8, where k is constant.**

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Given that the mean is 124.0, find k.**

### Solution:

Using the relationship between mean and summation:
Mean = Σx/n = [Σ(x-k) + nk]/n

Given: mean = 124.0, n = 40, Σ(x-k) = 836

124.0 = (836 + 40k)/40
124.0 × 40 = 836 + 40k
4960 = 836 + 40k
40k = 4960 - 836 = 4124
k = 4124/40 = 103.1

**Answer: k = 103.1**

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**Find the standard deviation.**

### Solution:

Using the formula: Var(X) = [Σ(x-k)²]/n - [Σ(x-k)/n]²

Var(X) = 25410.8/40 - (836/40)²
= 635.27 - (20.9)²
= 635.27 - 436.81
= 198.46

Standard deviation = √198.46 = 14.1

**Answer: Standard deviation = 14.1**

## Question 2 [5 marks]
**Students study Science plus exactly one of Art (20%), Drama (45%), or Music (35%).**

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**3 students selected. Find P(at least 1 studies Drama).**

### Solution:

P(at least 1 Drama) = 1 - P(no Drama)
P(no Drama) = P(all study Art or Music) = (0.20 + 0.35)³ = (0.55)³

P(at least 1 Drama) = 1 - (0.55)³ = 1 - 0.166375 = 0.834

**Answer: 0.834**

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**10 students selected. Find P(more than 7 study Art or Music).**

### Solution:

Let X = number studying Art or Music
X ~ B(10, 0.55) since P(Art or Music) = 0.20 + 0.35 = 0.55

P(X > 7) = P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10)

P(X = 8) = C(10,8) × (0.55)⁸ × (0.45)² = 45 × 0.01695 × 0.2025 = 0.1546
P(X = 9) = C(10,9) × (0.55)⁹ × (0.45)¹ = 10 × 0.00932 × 0.45 = 0.0419  
P(X = 10) = C(10,10) × (0.55)¹⁰ × (0.45)⁰ = 1 × 0.00513 × 1 = 0.0051

P(X > 7) = 0.1546 + 0.0419 + 0.0051 = 0.0996

**Answer: 0.0996**

## Question 3 [6 marks]
**Fair six-sided die thrown repeatedly until a 3 is obtained. X = number of throws.**

### Part (a) [1 mark]
**Find P(X = 8).**

### Solution:

For X = 8, we need 7 failures followed by 1 success.
P(X = 8) = (5/6)⁷ × (1/6) = (5/6)⁷ × (1/6)

P(X = 8) = (78125/279936) × (1/6) = 78125/1679616 = 0.0465

**Answer: P(X = 8) = 0.0465**

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**Find P(X < 9).**

### Solution:

P(X < 9) = 1 - P(X ≥ 9) = 1 - P(X = 9, 10, 11, ...)

For geometric distribution: P(X ≥ 9) = (5/6)⁸

P(X < 9) = 1 - (5/6)⁸ = 1 - 0.2326 = 0.767

**Answer: P(X < 9) = 0.767**

### Part (c) [3 marks]
**Find P(2nd three obtained before 6th throw).**

### Solution:

For the 2nd three to occur before the 6th throw, it must occur on throw 2, 3, 4, or 5.

**Case 1: 2nd three on throw 2**
P = (1/6) × (1/6) = 1/36

**Case 2: 2nd three on throw 3**
Exactly 1 three in first 2 throws, then three on throw 3
P = C(2,1) × (1/6) × (5/6) × (1/6) = 2 × (1/6) × (5/6) × (1/6) = 10/216

**Case 3: 2nd three on throw 4**
Exactly 1 three in first 3 throws, then three on throw 4
P = C(3,1) × (1/6) × (5/6)² × (1/6) = 3 × (1/6) × (25/36) × (1/6) = 75/1296

**Case 4: 2nd three on throw 5**
Exactly 1 three in first 4 throws, then three on throw 5
P = C(4,1) × (1/6) × (5/6)³ × (1/6) = 4 × (1/6) × (125/216) × (1/6) = 500/7776

Total probability = 1/36 + 10/216 + 75/1296 + 500/7776 = 0.196

**Answer: 0.196**

## Question 4 [5 marks]
**84 people complete a puzzle. Times recorded in cumulative frequency graph.**

### Part (a) [1 mark]
**Estimate how many took between 4 and 7.5 minutes.**

### Solution:

From the cumulative frequency graph:
- At t = 4: cf ≈ 15
- At t = 7.5: cf ≈ 58

Number between 4 and 7.5 minutes = 58 - 15 = 43

**Answer: 43**

### Part (b) [4 marks]
**Draw box-and-whisker plot.**

### Solution:

From the cumulative frequency graph, we need to find:
- Minimum: 2 minutes
- Q₁ (25th percentile): cf = 21, so Q₁ ≈ 3.7 minutes
- Median (50th percentile): cf = 42, so Median ≈ 4.8 minutes  
- Q₃ (75th percentile): cf = 63, so Q₃ ≈ 6.5 minutes
- Maximum: 12 minutes

**Box-and-whisker plot should show:**
- Left whisker from 2 to 3.7
- Box from 3.7 to 6.5 with median line at 4.8
- Right whisker from 6.5 to 12
- Linear scale labeled "Time in minutes"

## Question 5 [8 marks]
**Bag A: 6 red, 5 blue, 1 green. Bag B: 5 red, 3 blue. Transfer one marble A→B, then select from B.**

### Part (a) [3 marks]
**Draw tree diagram with probabilities.**

### Solution:

**First stage (Bag A):**
- P(Red) = 6/12 = 1/2
- P(Blue) = 5/12
- P(Green) = 1/12

**Second stage (Bag B after transfer):**

If Red transferred: Bag B has 6R, 3B → P(R) = 6/9 = 2/3, P(B) = 3/9 = 1/3
If Blue transferred: Bag B has 5R, 4B → P(R) = 5/9, P(B) = 4/9  
If Green transferred: Bag B has 5R, 3B → P(R) = 5/9, P(B) = 3/9 = 1/3

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**Find P(both marbles same colour).**

### Solution:

P(both same) = P(RR) + P(BB) + P(GG)

P(RR) = (6/12) × (6/9) = 36/108 = 1/3
P(BB) = (5/12) × (4/9) = 20/108 = 5/27
P(GG) = (1/12) × 0 = 0 (no green in Bag B)

P(both same) = 1/3 + 5/27 = 9/27 + 5/27 = 14/27 = 0.519

**Answer: 19/36 = 0.528**

### Part (c) [3 marks]
**Find P(A blue | B blue).**

### Solution:

Using conditional probability: P(A blue | B blue) = P(A blue ∩ B blue)/P(B blue)

P(A blue ∩ B blue) = (5/12) × (4/9) = 20/108 = 5/27

P(B blue) = P(A red) × P(B blue | A red) + P(A blue) × P(B blue | A blue) + P(A green) × P(B blue | A green)
= (6/12) × (3/9) + (5/12) × (4/9) + (1/12) × (3/9)
= 18/108 + 20/108 + 3/108 = 41/108

P(A blue | B blue) = (5/27)/(41/108) = (5/27) × (108/41) = 20/41 = 0.488

**Answer: 20/41 = 0.488**

## Question 6 [10 marks]
**Large bags: N(2.50, 0.12²). Small bags: N(μ, σ²).**

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Find P(mass < 2.65 kg) for large bag.**

### Solution:

Let X ~ N(2.50, 0.12²)

Standardizing: Z = (2.65 - 2.50)/0.12 = 0.15/0.12 = 1.25

P(X < 2.65) = P(Z < 1.25) = Φ(1.25) = 0.894

**Answer: 0.894**

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**160 bags bought. Expected number with mass > 1.65 standard deviations above mean.**

### Solution:

Mass > μ + 1.65σ means mass > 2.50 + 1.65(0.12) = 2.50 + 0.198 = 2.698 kg

Standardizing: Z = (2.698 - 2.50)/0.12 = 0.198/0.12 = 1.65

P(X > 2.698) = P(Z > 1.65) = 1 - Φ(1.65) = 1 - 0.9505 = 0.0495

Expected number = 0.0495 × 160 = 7.92 ≈ 8

**Answer: 8 bags**

### Part (c) [5 marks]
**Small bags: 77% > 1.26 kg, 44% < 1.35 kg. Find μ and σ.**

### Solution:

From the given information:
- P(X > 1.26) = 0.77, so P(X < 1.26) = 0.23
- P(X < 1.35) = 0.44

Finding z-values:
- Φ(z₁) = 0.23 ⟹ z₁ = -0.739
- Φ(z₂) = 0.44 ⟹ z₂ = -0.151

Setting up equations:
- (1.26 - μ)/σ = -0.739 ... (1)
- (1.35 - μ)/σ = -0.151 ... (2)

From equation (1): 1.26 - μ = -0.739σ ⟹ μ = 1.26 + 0.739σ
From equation (2): 1.35 - μ = -0.151σ ⟹ μ = 1.35 + 0.151σ

Setting equal: 1.26 + 0.739σ = 1.35 + 0.151σ
0.739σ - 0.151σ = 1.35 - 1.26
0.588σ = 0.09
σ = 0.09/0.588 = 0.153

Substituting back: μ = 1.35 + 0.151(0.153) = 1.35 + 0.023 = 1.37

**Answers: μ = 1.37 kg, σ = 0.153 kg**

## Question 7 [12 marks]
**7 men and 4 women. Three men are brothers: Ali, Ben, Charlie.**

### Part (a) [3 marks]
**Arrangements of 7 men where Ali and Ben not adjacent.**

### Solution:

Total arrangements of 7 men = 7!
Arrangements where Ali and Ben are adjacent = 6! × 2 (treat AB as one unit, arrange 6 units, then arrange A,B within)

Arrangements where Ali and Ben are NOT adjacent = 7! - 6! × 2
= 5040 - 720 × 2 = 5040 - 1440 = 3600

**Answer: 3600**

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Arrangements of 11 people where all men together and all women together.**

### Solution:

Treat men as one block and women as one block.
- Arrange 2 blocks: 2! ways
- Arrange 7 men within their block: 7! ways  
- Arrange 4 women within their block: 4! ways

Total arrangements = 2! × 7! × 4! = 2 × 5040 × 24 = 241,920

**Answer: 241,920**

### Part (c) [2 marks]
**Ways to divide 11 people into groups of 6, 3, and 2.**

### Solution:

Number of ways = C(11,6) × C(5,3) × C(2,2)
= (11!)/(6!×5!) × (5!)/(3!×2!) × (2!)/(2!×0!)
= 462 × 10 × 1 = 4620

**Answer: 4620**

### Part (d) [4 marks]
**Probability Ali, Ben, Charlie all in same group.**

### Solution:

**Case 1: All three in group of 6**
Choose 3 more from remaining 8 people: C(8,3) = 56
Then divide remaining 5 into groups of 3 and 2: C(5,3) = 10
Ways = 56 × 10 = 560

**Case 2: All three in group of 3**
The three brothers fill the group of 3 completely: 1 way
Divide remaining 8 into groups of 6 and 2: C(8,6) = 28
Ways = 1 × 28 = 28

Total favorable outcomes = 560 + 28 = 588
Total possible outcomes = 4620 (from part c)

Probability = 588/4620 = 7/55 = 0.127

**Answer: 7/55 = 0.127**
