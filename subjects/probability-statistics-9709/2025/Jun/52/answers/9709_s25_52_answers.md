## Question 1 [3 marks]
**Rachel has three coins with probabilities of heads: 1/3, 1/4, and 1/2 (fair). Find the probability distribution table for X, the number of tails.**

### Solution:

First, let's identify the probabilities:
- Coin 1: P(Head) = 1/3, P(Tail) = 2/3
- Coin 2: P(Head) = 1/4, P(Tail) = 3/4  
- Coin 3: P(Head) = 1/2, P(Tail) = 1/2

X can take values 0, 1, 2, or 3 tails.

**X = 0 (no tails, all heads):**
P(X = 0) = (1/3) × (1/4) × (1/2) = 1/24

**X = 1 (exactly one tail):**
- Tail on coin 1 only: (2/3) × (1/4) × (1/2) = 2/24
- Tail on coin 2 only: (1/3) × (3/4) × (1/2) = 3/24
- Tail on coin 3 only: (1/3) × (1/4) × (1/2) = 1/24
P(X = 1) = 2/24 + 3/24 + 1/24 = 6/24

**X = 2 (exactly two tails):**
- Tails on coins 1,2: (2/3) × (3/4) × (1/2) = 6/24
- Tails on coins 1,3: (2/3) × (1/4) × (1/2) = 2/24
- Tails on coins 2,3: (1/3) × (3/4) × (1/2) = 3/24
P(X = 2) = 6/24 + 2/24 + 3/24 = 11/24

**X = 3 (all tails):**
P(X = 3) = (2/3) × (3/4) × (1/2) = 6/24

### Probability Distribution Table:

| x | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P(X = x) | 1/24 | 6/24 | 11/24 | 6/24 |
| | 0.0417 | 0.25 | 0.458 | 0.25 |

**Verification:** 1/24 + 6/24 + 11/24 + 6/24 = 24/24 = 1 ✓

## Question 2 [5 marks]
**In Millford, 70% of residents own a bicycle. From a random sample of 160 residents, find the probability that more than 120 own a bicycle using a suitable approximation.**

### Solution:

Let X = number of residents who own a bicycle
X ~ B(160, 0.7)

Since n is large and np = 112 > 5, nq = 48 > 5, we can use normal approximation.

**Parameters for normal approximation:**
- Mean: μ = np = 160 × 0.7 = 112
- Variance: σ² = npq = 160 × 0.7 × 0.3 = 33.6
- Standard deviation: σ = √33.6 = 5.797

**Finding P(X > 120):**

Using continuity correction: P(X > 120) = P(X ≥ 120.5)

Standardizing: Z = (120.5 - 112)/√33.6 = 8.5/5.797 = 1.466

P(X > 120) = P(Z > 1.466) = 1 - Φ(1.466) = 1 - 0.9287 = 0.0713

**Answer: 0.0713**

## Question 3 [5 marks]
**A bag contains 4 blue and 12 red marbles. One marble is selected; if blue, it's replaced; if red, it's not replaced. Then a second marble is selected.**

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Find the probability that both marbles are the same colour.**

### Solution:

**Case 1: Both blue**
- First blue: P = 4/16
- Second blue (after replacement): P = 4/16
- P(both blue) = (4/16) × (4/16) = 16/256 = 1/16

**Case 2: Both red**
- First red: P = 12/16
- Second red (no replacement): P = 11/15
- P(both red) = (12/16) × (11/15) = 132/240 = 11/20

**P(both same colour) = 1/16 + 11/20 = 5/80 + 44/80 = 49/80 = 0.6125**

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Find P(first marble is blue | second marble is red).**

### Solution:

Using conditional probability: P(B₁|R₂) = P(B₁ ∩ R₂)/P(R₂)

**Finding P(B₁ ∩ R₂):**
- First blue, replaced: P = 4/16
- Second red from original bag: P = 12/16
- P(B₁ ∩ R₂) = (4/16) × (12/16) = 48/256 = 3/16

**Finding P(R₂):**
- Path 1: First blue, then red: (4/16) × (12/16) = 48/256
- Path 2: First red, then red: (12/16) × (11/15) = 132/240 = 176/256
- P(R₂) = 48/256 + 176/256 = 224/256 = 59/80

**P(B₁|R₂) = (3/16)/(59/80) = (3/16) × (80/59) = 240/944 = 15/59 = 0.254**

## Question 4 [6 marks]
**Vehicles at a junction: 30% turn left, 25% turn right, 45% go straight.**

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Find the probability that the next three vehicles all go in different directions.**

### Solution:

For three vehicles to go in different directions, we need one left, one right, one straight in any order.

Number of arrangements = 3! = 6
Probability = 6 × (0.3) × (0.25) × (0.45) = 6 × 0.03375 = 0.2025

**Answer: 0.2025**

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**Find the probability that the 1st vehicle to go left is before the 9th vehicle.**

### Solution:

This is equivalent to finding P(at least one left turn in first 8 vehicles).

P(1st left before 9th) = 1 - P(no left in first 8)
= 1 - (0.7)⁸ = 1 - 0.05764 = 0.942

**Answer: 0.942**

### Part (c) [2 marks]
**Find the probability that the 2nd vehicle to go left is the 7th vehicle.**

### Solution:

For the 2nd left turn to be on the 7th vehicle:
- Exactly 1 left turn in first 6 vehicles
- 7th vehicle turns left

This follows negative binomial distribution:
P = C(6,1) × (0.3)² × (0.7)⁵ = 6 × 0.09 × 0.16807 = 0.0908

**Answer: 0.0908**

## Question 5 [10 marks]
**Travel times to college for 300 students.**

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Draw cumulative frequency graph.**

### Solution:

Plot points at class upper boundaries:
- (10, 34), (20, 86), (30, 142), (40, 208), (60, 265), (90, 300)

Draw smooth curve through points, starting from (0,0).

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**120 students take more than k minutes. Find k.**

### Solution:

If 120 students take more than k minutes, then 300 - 120 = 180 students take k minutes or less.

From the cumulative frequency graph, read the time value where cf = 180.

**k = 35 minutes**

### Part (c) [6 marks]
**Calculate estimates of mean and standard deviation.**

### Solution:

**Step 1: Find frequencies and midpoints**

| Class | Frequency | Midpoint |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| 0-10  | 34        | 5        |
| 10-20 | 52        | 15       |
| 20-30 | 56        | 25       |
| 30-40 | 66        | 35       |
| 40-60 | 57        | 50       |
| 60-90 | 35        | 75       |

**Step 2: Calculate mean**

Mean = Σ(f × x)/Σf
= (34×5 + 52×15 + 56×25 + 66×35 + 57×50 + 35×75)/300
= (170 + 780 + 1400 + 2310 + 2850 + 2625)/300
= 10135/300 = 33.8 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate variance**

Variance = Σ(f × x²)/Σf - (mean)²
= (34×25 + 52×225 + 56×625 + 66×1225 + 57×2500 + 35×5625)/300 - (33.8)²
= (850 + 11700 + 35000 + 80850 + 142500 + 196875)/300 - 1142.44
= 467775/300 - 1142.44
= 1559.25 - 1142.44 = 416.81

**Standard deviation = √416.81 = 20.4 minutes**

**Answers: Mean = 33.8 minutes, Standard deviation = 20.4 minutes**

## Question 6 [9 marks]
**Arrangements of letters in AMALGAMATE (A-M-A-L-G-A-M-A-T-E)**
**Letters: A(4), M(2), L(1), G(1), T(1), E(1)**

### Part (a) [3 marks]
**Arrangements with M at beginning and end, no As together.**

### Solution:

With M at both ends: M _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ M

Remaining letters: A, A, A, A, L, G, T, E (8 letters with 4 As)

To ensure no As are together, we arrange the 4 non-A letters first: L, G, T, E
These can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways.

This creates 5 gaps: _ L _ G _ T _ E _

We need to place 4 As in these 5 gaps (at most one A per gap).
Number of ways = C(5,4) = 5

**Total arrangements = 4! × C(5,4) = 24 × 5 = 120**

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Arrangements with exactly 3 letters between the two Ms.**

### Solution:

Pattern: M _ _ _ M _ _ _ _ _

The two Ms and the 3 letters between them form a block of 5.
This block can be placed in 6 positions within the 10-letter arrangement.

Remaining 8 letters: A, A, A, A, L, G, T, E
These can be arranged in 8!/4! ways.

**Total arrangements = 6 × 8!/4! = 6 × 1680 = 10080**

### Part (c) [3 marks]
**Selections of 5 letters including at least one M and at least two As.**

### Solution:

**Case 1: 1M, 2A, 2 others**
- Choose 1M from 2: C(2,1) = 2
- Choose 2A from 4: C(4,2) = 6  
- Choose 2 from {L,G,T,E}: C(4,2) = 6
- Total: 2 × 6 × 6 = 72... but this counts selections, not arrangements

**Correct approach - counting selections:**

**Case 1: 1M, 2A, 2 others**
Ways = C(4,2) = 6

**Case 2: 1M, 3A, 1 other**  
Ways = C(4,1) = 4

**Case 3: 1M, 4A, 0 others**
Ways = C(4,0) = 1

**Case 4: 2M, 2A, 1 other**
Ways = C(4,1) = 4

**Case 5: 2M, 3A, 0 others**
Ways = C(4,0) = 1

**Total selections = 6 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 16**

## Question 7 [12 marks]
**Kestrel wingspans are normally distributed with mean 74.8 cm, standard deviation 3.2 cm.**

### Part (a) [4 marks]
**Expected number with wingspan between 72.4 cm and 76.3 cm from 120 kestrels.**

### Solution:

Let W ~ N(74.8, 3.2²)

**Standardizing:**
- Z₁ = (72.4 - 74.8)/3.2 = -2.4/3.2 = -0.75
- Z₂ = (76.3 - 74.8)/3.2 = 1.5/3.2 = 0.4688

**Finding probability:**
P(72.4 < W < 76.3) = P(-0.75 < Z < 0.4688)
= Φ(0.4688) - Φ(-0.75)
= Φ(0.4688) - (1 - Φ(0.75))
= 0.6804 - (1 - 0.7734)
= 0.6804 - 0.2266 = 0.4538

**Expected number = 0.4538 × 120 = 54.46 ≈ 54**

### Part (b) [5 marks]
**Masses are N(μ, σ²). 20% > 0.202 kg, 28% < 0.185 kg. Find μ and σ.**

### Solution:

**From the given information:**
- P(M > 0.202) = 0.20, so P(M < 0.202) = 0.80
- P(M < 0.185) = 0.28

**Finding z-values:**
- Φ(z₁) = 0.80 ⟹ z₁ = 0.842
- Φ(z₂) = 0.28 ⟹ z₂ = -0.583

**Setting up equations:**
- (0.202 - μ)/σ = 0.842 ... (1)
- (0.185 - μ)/σ = -0.583 ... (2)

**From equation (1):** 0.202 - μ = 0.842σ
**From equation (2):** 0.185 - μ = -0.583σ

**Subtracting:** 0.202 - 0.185 = 0.842σ - (-0.583σ)
0.017 = 1.425σ
σ = 0.017/1.425 = 0.0119

**Substituting back:** μ = 0.202 - 0.842 × 0.0119 = 0.202 - 0.010 = 0.192

**Answers: μ = 0.192 kg, σ = 0.0119 kg**

### Part (c) [3 marks]
**10 kestrels selected. Find P(fewer than 3 have mass > 0.202 kg).**

### Solution:

From part (b), P(mass > 0.202) = 0.20

Let Y = number with mass > 0.202 kg
Y ~ B(10, 0.2)

P(Y < 3) = P(Y = 0) + P(Y = 1) + P(Y = 2)

P(Y = 0) = C(10,0) × (0.2)⁰ × (0.8)¹⁰ = 1 × 1 × 0.1074 = 0.1074
P(Y = 1) = C(10,1) × (0.2)¹ × (0.8)⁹ = 10 × 0.2 × 0.1342 = 0.2684  
P(Y = 2) = C(10,2) × (0.2)² × (0.8)⁸ = 45 × 0.04 × 0.1678 = 0.3020

P(Y < 3) = 0.1074 + 0.2684 + 0.3020 = 0.678

**Answer: 0.678**
