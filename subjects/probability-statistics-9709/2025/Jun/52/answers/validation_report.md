## Question-by-Question Validation

### Question 1: Probability Distribution [3 marks] ✅

**Mark Scheme Requirements:**

- B1: Four correct probabilities linked with correct outcomes

**Solution Validation:**
- ✅ **B1 Achieved:** Table shows x = 0,1,2,3 with P(X=0) = 1/24 = 0.0417 (correct)
- ✅ **B1 Achieved:** P(X=1) = 6/24 = 0.25 and P(X=2) = 11/24 = 0.458 (both correct)
- ✅ **B1 Achieved:** All four probabilities correct: 1/24, 6/24, 11/24, 6/24

**Technical Verification:**
- Coin probabilities correctly identified: P(T₁)=2/3, P(T₂)=3/4, P(T₃)=1/2
- All combinations systematically calculated
- Probabilities sum to 1: 1/24 + 6/24 + 11/24 + 6/24 = 24/24 = 1 ✓

- A1: Final answer AWRT 0.0713

**Solution Validation:**
- ✅ **B1 Achieved:** μ = np = 160×0.7 = 112, σ² = npq = 160×0.7×0.3 = 33.6
- ✅ **M1 Achieved:** Z = (120.5 - 112)/√33.6 standardisation formula used
- ✅ **M1 Achieved:** Continuity correction applied: P(X > 120) = P(X ≥ 120.5)
- ✅ **M1 Achieved:** P(Z > 1.466) = 1 - Φ(1.466) = 1 - 0.9287
- ✅ **A1 Achieved:** Final answer 0.0713 matches mark scheme exactly

**Technical Verification:**
- Normal approximation justified: np = 112 > 5, nq = 48 > 5
- Standardisation: Z = 8.5/5.797 = 1.466 (correct)
- Probability calculation: 1 - 0.9287 = 0.0713 (correct)
