## Question 1 [3 marks]
**40 club members travel to a concert. 35 in coach, 5 in car. Ranuf must be in coach, Saed must be in car. How many ways to choose coach members?**

### Solution:
Since Ranuf must be in the coach and Saed must be in the car, we need to choose 34 more people for the coach from the remaining 38 members.

Number of ways = ³⁸C₃₄ = ³⁸C₄ = (38 × 37 × 36 × 35)/(4 × 3 × 2 × 1) = 1,757,160/24 = 73,815

**Answer: 73,815**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: ³⁸Cᵣ or ⁿC₃₄ expression seen
✓ A1: ³⁸C₃₄ correct unsimplified
✓ A1: 73,815

## Question 2 [8 marks total]
**Fair die thrown repeatedly until 1 or 6 obtained.**

### Part (a) [3 marks]
**Find P(takes at least 3 throws but no more than 5 throws).**

### Solution:
P(1 or 6) = 2/6 = 1/3
P(not 1 or 6) = 4/6 = 2/3

P(exactly 3 throws) = (2/3)² × (1/3) = 4/27
P(exactly 4 throws) = (2/3)³ × (1/3) = 8/81
P(exactly 5 throws) = (2/3)⁴ × (1/3) = 16/243

P(3 ≤ X ≤ 5) = 4/27 + 8/81 + 16/243
                = 36/243 + 24/243 + 16/243 = 76/243 ≈ 0.313

**Answer: 76/243 = 0.313**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: One correct term with 0 < p < 1
✓ A1: Correct expression (4/27 + 8/81 + 16/243)
✓ A1: 76/243 or 0.313

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Die thrown 3 times. X = number of times 1 or 6 obtained. Draw probability distribution table.**

### Solution:
X ~ B(3, 1/3)

P(X = 0) = ³C₀ × (1/3)⁰ × (2/3)³ = 1 × 1 × 8/27 = 8/27
P(X = 1) = ³C₁ × (1/3)¹ × (2/3)² = 3 × 1/3 × 4/9 = 12/27
P(X = 2) = ³C₂ × (1/3)² × (2/3)¹ = 3 × 1/9 × 2/3 = 6/27
P(X = 3) = ³C₃ × (1/3)³ × (2/3)⁰ = 1 × 1/27 × 1 = 1/27

| X | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P(X) | 8/27 | 12/27 | 6/27 | 1/27 |

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: Probability distribution table with correct values of x, at least one non-zero probability
✓ B1: 1 correct probability seen or 3 or 4 non-zero probabilities summing to 1
✓ B1: All probabilities correct

### Part (c) [2 marks]
**Find E(X).**

### Solution:
E(X) = 0×(8/27) + 1×(12/27) + 2×(6/27) + 3×(1/27)
     = 0 + 12/27 + 12/27 + 3/27 = 27/27 = 1

Alternatively, since X ~ B(3, 1/3): E(X) = np = 3 × (1/3) = 1

**Answer: E(X) = 1**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: Correct method from their probability distribution table with at least 3 terms
✓ A1: 1

## Question 3 [7 marks total]
**Apple weights ~ N(82, σ²). 22% weigh more than 87g.**

### Part (a) [3 marks]
**Find the standard deviation.**

### Solution:
Let X = weight of apple, X ~ N(82, σ²)

P(X > 87) = 0.22
P(X ≤ 87) = 0.78

Standardizing: P(Z ≤ (87-82)/σ) = 0.78
P(Z ≤ 5/σ) = 0.78

From normal tables: Φ(0.772) = 0.78
So: 5/σ = 0.772
σ = 5/0.772 = 6.48

**Answer: σ = 6.48 grams**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: Using ±standardisation formula P(Z > 5/σ) = 0.22
✓ B1: AWRT ±0.772 seen
✓ A1: σ = 6.48

### Part (b) [4 marks]
**Find P(weight differs from mean by less than 4g).**

### Solution:
P(|X - 82| < 4) = P(78 < X < 86)

Standardizing:
P((78-82)/6.48 < Z < (86-82)/6.48) = P(-0.617 < Z < 0.617)

P(-0.617 < Z < 0.617) = Φ(0.617) - Φ(-0.617) = Φ(0.617) - (1 - Φ(0.617))
                       = 2Φ(0.617) - 1 = 2(0.7317) - 1 = 0.463

**Answer: 0.463**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: Using ±4 within standardisation formula
✓ M1: Standardisation formula applied to both ±4
✓ M1: Correct area 2Φ - 1 linked to final solution
✓ A1: 0.463

## Question 4 [6 marks total]
**Richard has 3 blue, 2 red, 6 green candles arranged in a line.**

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Find arrangements with red candle at each end.**

### Solution:
Fix red candles at both ends. Arrange remaining 9 candles (3 blue, 6 green) in middle positions.

Number of arrangements = 9!/(3! × 6!) = 362880/(6 × 720) = 362880/4320 = 84

**Answer: 84**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: 9! alone on numerator, 3! × k or 6! × k on denominator
✓ A1: 84

### Part (b) [4 marks]
**Find arrangements where all blue candles are together and red candles are not together.**

### Solution:
Step 1: Treat 3 blue candles as one unit (BBB). We now have 9 objects to arrange: (BBB), R, R, G, G, G, G, G, G

Step 2: Total arrangements with blues together = 9!/(2! × 6!) = 362880/1440 = 252

Step 3: Arrangements with blues together AND reds together:
Treat (BBB) and (RR) as single units. Arrange 8 objects: (BBB), (RR), G, G, G, G, G, G
Number = 8!/6! = 40320/720 = 56

Step 4: Arrangements with blues together but reds NOT together = 252 - 56 = 196

**Answer: 196**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: 7!/6! × k or 7k seen, k an integer > 0
✓ M1: ⁿCₘ or ⁿPₘ × (n-m)!/k!, n=7,8 or 9, m an integer > 0
✓ M1: n = 8 used in above expression
✓ A1: 196

## Question 5 [8 marks total]
**In Greenton, 70% of adults own a car.**

### Part (a) [3 marks]
**Random sample of 8 adults. Find P(fewer than 6 own a car).**

### Solution:
Let X = number who own a car, X ~ B(8, 0.7)

P(X < 6) = 1 - P(X ≥ 6) = 1 - [P(X=6) + P(X=7) + P(X=8)]

P(X=6) = ⁸C₆ × (0.7)⁶ × (0.3)² = 28 × 0.117649 × 0.09 = 0.2965
P(X=7) = ⁸C₇ × (0.7)⁷ × (0.3)¹ = 8 × 0.082354 × 0.3 = 0.1977
P(X=8) = ⁸C₈ × (0.7)⁸ × (0.3)⁰ = 1 × 0.057648 × 1 = 0.0576

P(X < 6) = 1 - (0.2965 + 0.1977 + 0.0576) = 1 - 0.5518 = 0.448

**Answer: 0.448**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: One term ⁸Cₓ × pˣ × (1-p)⁸⁻ˣ, 0 < p < 1, x ≠ 0
✓ A1: Correct unsimplified expression
✓ A1: 0.448

### Part (b) [5 marks]
**Sample of 120 adults. Use approximation to find P(more than 75 own a car).**

### Solution:
Let Y = number who own a car, Y ~ B(120, 0.7)

Using normal approximation:
μ = np = 120 × 0.7 = 84
σ² = np(1-p) = 120 × 0.7 × 0.3 = 25.2
σ = √25.2 = 5.02

With continuity correction:
P(Y > 75) = P(Y ≥ 75.5)

Standardizing: Z = (75.5 - 84)/5.02 = -8.5/5.02 = -1.693

P(Y > 75) = P(Z > -1.693) = Φ(1.693) = 0.955

**Answer: 0.955**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: Correct mean = 84 and variance = 25.2
✓ M1: Substituting μ and σ into ±standardising formula
✓ M1: Using continuity correction 75.5
✓ M1: Appropriate area Φ from final process
✓ A1: 0.955 (allow 0.9545 < p ≤ 0.955)

### Part (a) [3 marks]
**Complete the tree diagram with probabilities.**

### Solution:
From Box A:
- P(Red) = 7/8
- P(Blue) = 1/8

From Box B after red ball added (10 red, 5 blue):
- P(Red) = 10/15 = 2/3
- P(Blue) = 5/15 = 1/3

From Box B after blue ball added (9 red, 6 blue):
- P(Red) = 9/15 = 3/5
- P(Blue) = 6/15 = 2/5

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: Both correct probabilities for box A
✓ B1: 2 probabilities correct for box B
✓ B1: All correct probabilities for box B

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**Find P(two balls chosen are not the same colour).**

### Solution:
P(different colours) = P(Red from A, Blue from B) + P(Blue from A, Red from B)
                     = (7/8) × (1/3) + (1/8) × (3/5)
                     = 7/24 + 3/40
                     = 35/120 + 9/120 = 44/120 = 11/30 ≈ 0.367

**Answer: 11/30 = 0.367**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: Two 2-factor terms added, correct or FT their 6(a)
✓ A1: 44/120 or 11/30 or 0.367

### Part (c) [4 marks]
**Find P(ball from A is blue | ball from B is blue).**

### Solution:
Using Bayes' theorem: P(A blue | B blue) = P(A blue ∩ B blue) / P(B blue)

P(A blue ∩ B blue) = (1/8) × (2/5) = 2/40 = 1/20

P(B blue) = P(A red) × P(B blue | A red) + P(A blue) × P(B blue | A blue)
          = (7/8) × (1/3) + (1/8) × (2/5)
          = 7/24 + 2/40 = 35/120 + 6/120 = 41/120

P(A blue | B blue) = (1/20) / (41/120) = (1/20) × (120/41) = 6/41 ≈ 0.146

**Answer: 6/41 = 0.146**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: their (1/8) × (2/5) seen as numerator or denominator of fraction
✓ M1: their (7/8) × (1/3) + (1/8) × (2/5) seen
✓ M1: their (7/8) × (1/3) + (1/8) × (2/5) seen as denominator
✓ A1: 6/41 or 0.146

## Question 7 [9 marks total]
**Fish lengths measured for 150 fish.**

| Length (cm) | 0-9 | 10-14 | 15-19 | 20-30 |
|-------------|-----|-------|-------|-------|
| Frequency   | 15  | 48    | 66    | 21    |

### Part (a) [4 marks]
**Draw cumulative frequency graph.**

### Solution:
Cumulative frequencies:
- Up to 9.5: 15
- Up to 14.5: 15 + 48 = 63
- Up to 19.5: 63 + 66 = 129
- Up to 30.5: 129 + 21 = 150

Plot points: (9.5, 15), (14.5, 63), (19.5, 129), (30.5, 150)
Start from (0, 0) and join with smooth curve.

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: Correct cumulative frequencies (15, 63, 129, 150)
✓ B1: Correct axis labels and scales (0 ≤ horizontal ≤ 30, 0 ≤ vertical ≤ 150)
✓ M1: At least 3 points plotted at upper end points with linear horizontal scale
✓ A1: All points at correct upper end points, curve drawn accurately, joined to (0,0)

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**40% of fish have length d cm or more. Estimate d.**

### Solution:
40% of 150 = 60 fish have length d cm or more
So 60% of 150 = 90 fish have length less than d cm

From the cumulative frequency graph, when cf = 90, length ≈ 16.5 cm

**Answer: d ≈ 16.5 cm**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: 90 seen or implied by use on graph
✓ A1: Approximately 16.5 cm (FT their graph)

### Part (c) [3 marks]
**Mean = 15.295 cm. Calculate estimate for variance.**

### Solution:
Using midpoints: 4.75, 12, 17, 25

Variance = Σfx²/Σf - (mean)²

Σfx² = 15×(4.75)² + 48×(12)² + 66×(17)² + 21×(25)²
     = 15×22.5625 + 48×144 + 66×289 + 21×625
     = 338.4375 + 6912 + 19074 + 13125 = 39449.4375

Variance = 39449.4375/150 - (15.295)²
         = 262.996 - 233.938 = 29.1

**Answer: Variance = 29.1**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: At least 3 correct midpoints used
✓ M1: Using midpoints in correct variance formula with subtraction of μ²
✓ A1: 29.1
