## Question 1: Combinations [3 marks]
**The 40 members of a club include Ranuf and Saed. All 40 members will travel to a concert. 35 members will travel in a coach and the other 5 will travel in a car. Ranuf will be in the coach and Saed will be in the car. In how many ways can the members who will travel in the coach be chosen?**

### Solution:
Since Ranuf must be in the coach and Saed must be in the car, we need to choose 34 more members from the remaining 38 members to join Ranuf in the coach.

Number of ways = C(38, 34) = C(38, 4) = 38!/(4! × 34!)

C(38, 4) = (38 × 37 × 36 × 35)/(4 × 3 × 2 × 1) = 1,851,150/24 = 73,815

**Answer: 73,815 ways**

## Question 2: Geometric Distribution [8 marks]

### Part (a): Probability calculation [3 marks]
**An ordinary fair die is thrown repeatedly until a 1 or a 6 is obtained. Find the probability that it takes at least 3 throws but no more than 5 throws to obtain a 1 or a 6.**

### Solution:
Let X = number of throws needed to get a 1 or a 6
- P(success) = P(1 or 6) = 2/6 = 1/3
- P(failure) = P(not 1 or 6) = 4/6 = 2/3

This follows a geometric distribution: P(X = r) = (2/3)^(r-1) × (1/3)

P(3 ≤ X ≤ 5) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5)

P(X = 3) = (2/3)² × (1/3) = 4/27
P(X = 4) = (2/3)³ × (1/3) = 8/81  
P(X = 5) = (2/3)⁴ × (1/3) = 16/243

P(3 ≤ X ≤ 5) = 4/27 + 8/81 + 16/243 = 36/243 + 24/243 + 16/243 = 76/243

**Answer: 76/243**

### Part (b): Probability distribution table [3 marks]
**The die is thrown 3 times. The random variable X is the number of times that a 1 or a 6 is obtained. Draw up the probability distribution table for X.**

### Solution:
X ~ B(3, 1/3) where n = 3, p = 1/3

| X | P(X = x) | Calculation |
|---|----------|-------------|
| 0 | 8/27 | C(3,0) × (1/3)⁰ × (2/3)³ = 1 × 1 × 8/27 |
| 1 | 12/27 | C(3,1) × (1/3)¹ × (2/3)² = 3 × 1/3 × 4/9 |
| 2 | 6/27 | C(3,2) × (1/3)² × (2/3)¹ = 3 × 1/9 × 2/3 |
| 3 | 1/27 | C(3,3) × (1/3)³ × (2/3)⁰ = 1 × 1/27 × 1 |

### Part (c): Expected value [2 marks]
**Find E(X).**

### Solution:
For a binomial distribution, E(X) = np
E(X) = 3 × (1/3) = 1

**Answer: E(X) = 1**

## Question 3: Normal Distribution [7 marks]

### Part (a): Finding standard deviation [3 marks]
**The weights of apples are normally distributed with mean 82 grams. 22% of these apples have a weight greater than 87 grams. Find the standard deviation.**

### Solution:
Let X ~ N(82, σ²)
P(X > 87) = 0.22
P(X ≤ 87) = 0.78

Standardizing: P(Z ≤ (87-82)/σ) = 0.78
P(Z ≤ 5/σ) = 0.78

From normal tables: Φ⁻¹(0.78) ≈ 0.772
Therefore: 5/σ = 0.772
σ = 5/0.772 ≈ 6.48

**Answer: σ ≈ 6.48 grams**

### Part (b): Probability calculation [4 marks]
**Find the probability that the weight of a randomly chosen apple differs from the mean weight by less than 4 grams.**

### Solution:
We need P(|X - 82| < 4) = P(-4 < X - 82 < 4) = P(78 < X < 86)

Using σ = 6.48:
P(78 < X < 86) = P((78-82)/6.48 < Z < (86-82)/6.48)
= P(-0.617 < Z < 0.617)
= Φ(0.617) - Φ(-0.617)
= Φ(0.617) - (1 - Φ(0.617))
= 2Φ(0.617) - 1
≈ 2(0.7317) - 1 = 0.463

**Answer: 0.463**

## Question 4: Permutations [6 marks]

### Part (a): Arrangements with constraints [2 marks]
**Richard has 3 blue, 2 red and 6 green candles. Find the number of different arrangements if there is a red candle at each end.**

### Solution:
With red candles fixed at both ends, we arrange the remaining 9 candles (3 blue, 6 green) in the middle 9 positions.

Number of arrangements = 9!/(3! × 6!) = 84

**Answer: 84**

### Part (b): Complex constraints [4 marks]
**Find the number of arrangements if all blue candles are together and the red candles are not together.**

### Solution:
Step 1: Treat the 3 blue candles as one unit
We now have 9 objects to arrange: 1 blue unit, 2 red candles, 6 green candles

Step 2: Ensure red candles are not together
Total arrangements with blue together = 9!/(2! × 6!) = 252
Arrangements with both blue together AND red together:
- Treat red candles as one unit: 8 objects (1 blue unit, 1 red unit, 6 green)
- Arrangements = 8!/6! = 56

Step 3: Apply inclusion-exclusion
Arrangements with blue together but red not together = 252 - 56 = 196

**Answer: 196**

## Question 5: Binomial Distribution and Normal Approximation [8 marks]

### Part (a): Binomial probability [3 marks]
**In Greenton, 70% of adults own a car. A random sample of 8 adults is chosen. Find the probability that fewer than 6 own a car.**

### Solution:
Let X ~ B(8, 0.7)
P(X < 6) = P(X ≤ 5) = 1 - P(X ≥ 6) = 1 - [P(X = 6) + P(X = 7) + P(X = 8)]

P(X = 6) = C(8,6) × (0.7)⁶ × (0.3)² = 28 × 0.117649 × 0.09 = 0.2965
P(X = 7) = C(8,7) × (0.7)⁷ × (0.3)¹ = 8 × 0.082354 × 0.3 = 0.1977
P(X = 8) = C(8,8) × (0.7)⁸ × (0.3)⁰ = 1 × 0.057648 × 1 = 0.0576

P(X < 6) = 1 - (0.2965 + 0.1977 + 0.0576) = 1 - 0.5518 = 0.448

**Answer: 0.448**

### Part (b): Normal approximation [5 marks]
**A sample of 120 adults is chosen. Use an approximation to find the probability that more than 75 own a car.**

### Solution:
X ~ B(120, 0.7)
μ = np = 120 × 0.7 = 84
σ² = np(1-p) = 120 × 0.7 × 0.3 = 25.2
σ = √25.2 ≈ 5.02

Using normal approximation with continuity correction:
P(X > 75) = P(X ≥ 76) ≈ P(Y > 75.5) where Y ~ N(84, 25.2)

Standardizing: P(Z > (75.5-84)/5.02) = P(Z > -1.693)
= 1 - Φ(-1.693) = Φ(1.693) ≈ 0.955

**Answer: 0.955**

## Question 6: Conditional Probability [9 marks]

### Part (a): Tree diagram completion [3 marks]
**Box A contains 7 red and 1 blue ball. Box B contains 9 red and 5 blue balls. Complete the tree diagram showing probabilities.**

### Solution:
From Box A: P(Red) = 7/8, P(Blue) = 1/8

If red ball transferred to Box B: Box B has 10 red, 5 blue (total 15)
- P(Red from B) = 10/15 = 2/3
- P(Blue from B) = 5/15 = 1/3

If blue ball transferred to Box B: Box B has 9 red, 6 blue (total 15)  
- P(Red from B) = 9/15 = 3/5
- P(Blue from B) = 6/15 = 2/5

### Part (b): Probability of different colors [2 marks]
**Find the probability that the two balls chosen are not the same color.**

### Solution:
P(different colors) = P(Red from A, Blue from B) + P(Blue from A, Red from B)
= (7/8 × 1/3) + (1/8 × 3/5)
= 7/24 + 3/40
= 35/120 + 9/120 = 44/120 = 11/30

**Answer: 11/30**

### Part (c): Conditional probability [4 marks]
**Find P(Blue from A | Blue from B).**

### Solution:
Using Bayes' theorem:
P(Blue from A | Blue from B) = P(Blue from A and Blue from B) / P(Blue from B)

P(Blue from A and Blue from B) = 1/8 × 2/5 = 2/40 = 1/20

P(Blue from B) = P(Red from A) × P(Blue from B | Red from A) + P(Blue from A) × P(Blue from B | Blue from A)
= 7/8 × 1/3 + 1/8 × 2/5 = 7/24 + 2/40 = 35/120 + 6/120 = 41/120

P(Blue from A | Blue from B) = (1/20) ÷ (41/120) = (1/20) × (120/41) = 6/41

**Answer: 6/41**

## Question 7: Statistics and Cumulative Frequency [9 marks]

### Part (a): Cumulative frequency graph [4 marks]
**Draw a cumulative frequency graph for the fish length data.**

### Solution:
| Length (cm) | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| 0-9         | 15        | 15                  |
| 10-14       | 48        | 63                  |
| 15-19       | 66        | 129                 |
| 20-30       | 21        | 150                 |

Plot points at: (9.5, 15), (14.5, 63), (19.5, 129), (30.5, 150)

### Part (b): Finding percentile [2 marks]
**40% of fish have length d cm or more. Estimate d.**

### Solution:
40% of 150 = 60 fish have length d or more
This means 90 fish have length less than d
From the graph, when cumulative frequency = 90, length ≈ 16.5 cm

**Answer: d ≈ 16.5 cm**

### Part (c): Variance calculation [3 marks]
**Calculate an estimate for the variance given mean = 15.295 cm.**

### Solution:
Using mid-points: 4.5, 12, 17, 25

Σfx² = 15×(4.5)² + 48×(12)² + 66×(17)² + 21×(25)²
= 15×20.25 + 48×144 + 66×289 + 21×625
= 303.75 + 6912 + 19074 + 13125 = 39414.75

Variance = (Σfx²/n) - x̄²
= (39414.75/150) - (15.295)²
= 262.765 - 233.938
= 28.827

**Answer: Variance ≈ 28.8**
