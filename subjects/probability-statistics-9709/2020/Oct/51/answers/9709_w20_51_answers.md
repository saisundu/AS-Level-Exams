## Question 1 (4 marks)

### Part (a) - P(A ∩ B) [2 marks]

**Given:**
- Event A: Red die score divisible by 3 (scores: 3, 6)
- Event B: Sum of scores ≥ 9

**Solution:**
P(A) = 2/6 = 1/3 (red die shows 3 or 6)

For P(A ∩ B), we need red die = 3 or 6, AND sum ≥ 9:

**Red die = 3:** Sum ≥ 9 requires blue die ≥ 6, so blue die = 6
- Outcomes: (3,6)
- Probability: 1/36

**Red die = 6:** Sum ≥ 9 requires blue die ≥ 3, so blue die = 3,4,5,6
- Outcomes: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)
- Probability: 4/36

P(A ∩ B) = 1/36 + 4/36 = 5/36

**Answer:** P(A ∩ B) = 5/36

**Marks awarded:** 2 marks

### Part (b) - Independence Test [2 marks]

**Solution:**
For independence, we need P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)

First find P(B):
Sum ≥ 9 occurs for: (3,6), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)
P(B) = 10/36 = 5/18

Check independence:
P(A) × P(B) = (1/3) × (5/18) = 5/54

P(A ∩ B) = 5/36

Since 5/36 ≠ 5/54, the events are NOT independent.

**Answer:** Events A and B are not independent

## Question 2 (5 marks)

### Part (a) - Find value of x [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Let B = plays in band, C = sings in choir

Given:
- P(B) = 0.6, so P(B') = 0.4
- P(C|B) = 0.3
- P(C|B') = x
- P(C') = 0.58, so P(C) = 0.42

Using law of total probability:
P(C) = P(C|B) × P(B) + P(C|B') × P(B')
0.42 = 0.3 × 0.6 + x × 0.4
0.42 = 0.18 + 0.4x
0.24 = 0.4x
x = 0.6

**Answer:** x = 0.6

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

### Part (b) - Both students play in band and sing in choir [2 marks]

**Solution:**
P(student plays in band AND sings in choir) = P(B ∩ C) = P(C|B) × P(B) = 0.3 × 0.6 = 0.18

For two independent students:
P(both play in band and sing in choir) = (0.18)² = 0.0324

**Answer:** 0.0324

## Question 3 (5 marks)

### Part (a) - Geometric Distribution [2 marks]

**Solution:**
P(success) = 0.25, P(failure) = 0.75

P(more than 6 throws for first success) = P(first 6 throws are failures)
= (0.75)⁶ = 0.178

**Answer:** 0.178

**Marks awarded:** 2 marks

### Part (b) - Binomial Distribution [3 marks]

**Solution:**
X ~ B(10, 0.25) where X = number of successes

P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X ≤ 2) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)]

P(X = 0) = C(10,0) × (0.25)⁰ × (0.75)¹⁰ = 0.0563
P(X = 1) = C(10,1) × (0.25)¹ × (0.75)⁹ = 0.1877
P(X = 2) = C(10,2) × (0.25)² × (0.75)⁸ = 0.2816

P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - (0.0563 + 0.1877 + 0.2816) = 1 - 0.5256 = 0.474

**Answer:** 0.474

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

## Question 4 (6 marks)

### Part (a) - Probability Distribution Table for Y [4 marks]

**Solution:**
X takes values 1, 2, 3, 4 each with probability 1/4.
Two independent values chosen.

**Case 1: Both values same (Y = that value)**
- P(both = 1) = (1/4)² = 1/16, so P(Y = 1) = 1/16
- P(both = 2) = (1/4)² = 1/16, so P(Y = 2) = 1/16
- P(both = 3) = (1/4)² = 1/16, so P(Y = 3) = 1/16
- P(both = 4) = (1/4)² = 1/16, so P(Y = 4) = 1/16

**Case 2: Values different (Y = larger - smaller)**
- Y = 1: (2,1), (1,2) → P(Y = 1) = 2 × (1/4)² = 2/16
- Y = 2: (3,1), (1,3), (4,2), (2,4) → P(Y = 2) = 4 × (1/4)² = 4/16
- Y = 3: (4,1), (1,4), (4,3), (3,4) → P(Y = 3) = 4 × (1/4)² = 4/16

**Complete distribution:**
- P(Y = 1) = 1/16 + 2/16 = 3/16
- P(Y = 2) = 1/16 + 4/16 = 5/16
- P(Y = 3) = 1/16 + 4/16 = 5/16
- P(Y = 4) = 1/16

| Y | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P(Y=y) | 3/16 | 5/16 | 5/16 | 1/16 |

**Marks awarded:** 4 marks

### Part (b) - Conditional Probability [2 marks]

**Solution:**
P(Y = 2 | Y is even) = P(Y = 2 ∩ Y is even) / P(Y is even)

Y is even when Y = 2 or Y = 4
P(Y is even) = P(Y = 2) + P(Y = 4) = 5/16 + 1/16 = 6/16 = 3/8

P(Y = 2 ∩ Y is even) = P(Y = 2) = 5/16

P(Y = 2 | Y is even) = (5/16) / (3/8) = (5/16) × (8/3) = 5/6

**Answer:** 5/6

**Marks awarded:** 2 marks

## Question 5 (9 marks)

### Part (a) - Normal Distribution [3 marks]

**Given:** X ~ N(3.5, 0.9²)

**Solution:**
P(X > 4.2) = P(Z > (4.2-3.5)/0.9) = P(Z > 0.778)
= 1 - Φ(0.778) = 1 - 0.7817 = 0.218

**Answer:** 0.218

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

### Part (b) - Inverse Normal [3 marks]

**Solution:**
P(X > t) = 0.90
P(X ≤ t) = 0.10

P(Z ≤ (t-3.5)/0.9) = 0.10

From normal tables: Φ⁻¹(0.10) = -1.282

(t-3.5)/0.9 = -1.282
t - 3.5 = -1.1538
t = 2.35

**Answer:** t = 2.35

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

### Part (c) - Normal Probability Application [3 marks]

**Solution:**
P(2.8 < X < 4.2) = P((2.8-3.5)/0.9 < Z < (4.2-3.5)/0.9)
= P(-0.778 < Z < 0.778)
= Φ(0.778) - Φ(-0.778)
= 0.7817 - (1 - 0.7817) = 0.7817 - 0.2183 = 0.563

Expected number of days = 365 × 0.563 = 206

**Answer:** 206 days

## Question 6 (10 marks)

### Part (a) - Cumulative Frequency Graph [2 marks]

**Solution:**
Plot points: (20, 12), (30, 48), (40, 106), (60, 134), (100, 150)
Join with smooth curve, label axes appropriately.

**Marks awarded:** 2 marks

### Part (b) - Using Graph [2 marks]

**Solution:**
24% of 150 students = 36 students take k minutes or longer
This means 150 - 36 = 114 students take less than k minutes

From graph, draw horizontal line from cf = 114 to meet curve, then read down to time axis.

**Answer:** k ≈ 42 minutes

**Marks awarded:** 2 marks

### Part (c) - Mean and Standard Deviation [6 marks]

**Solution:**
Using class intervals and midpoints:

| Class | Midpoint | Frequency | fx | fx² |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----|-----|
| 0-20  | 10       | 12        | 120 | 1200 |
| 20-30 | 25       | 36        | 900 | 22500 |
| 30-40 | 35       | 58        | 2030| 71050 |
| 40-60 | 50       | 28        | 1400| 70000 |
| 60-100| 80       | 16        | 1280| 102400 |

Totals: Σf = 150, Σfx = 5730, Σfx² = 267150

Mean = Σfx/Σf = 5730/150 = 38.2 minutes

Variance = Σfx²/Σf - (mean)² = 267150/150 - (38.2)² = 1781 - 1459.24 = 321.76

Standard deviation = √321.76 = 17.9 minutes

**Answer:** Mean = 38.2 minutes, Standard deviation = 17.9 minutes

## Question 7 (11 marks)

### Part (a) - Arrangements with Es together [2 marks]

**Solution:**
SHOPKEEPER has: S(1), H(1), O(1), P(2), K(1), E(3), R(1)

Treat EEE as one unit: (EEE), S, H, O, P, P, K, R = 8 units with 2 Ps

Arrangements = 8!/2! = 20,160

**Answer:** 20,160

**Marks awarded:** 2 marks

### Part (b) - Ps not next to each other [4 marks]

**Solution:**
Total arrangements = 10!/(2!×3!) = 302,400

Arrangements with Ps together:
Treat PP as one unit: (PP), S, H, O, K, E, E, E, R = 9 units with 3 Es
Arrangements with Ps together = 9!/3! = 60,480

Arrangements with Ps NOT together = 302,400 - 60,480 = 241,920

**Answer:** 241,920

**Marks awarded:** 4 marks

### Part (c) - E at beginning and end [2 marks]

**Solution:**
Total arrangements = 10!/(2!×3!) = 302,400

Arrangements with E at start and E at end:
Fix E at positions 1 and 10, arrange remaining 8 letters (including 1 E and 2 Ps)
= 8!/(2!×1!) = 20,160

Probability = 20,160/302,400 = 1/15

**Answer:** 1/15

**Marks awarded:** 2 marks

### Part (d) - Selection with exactly one P [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Letters available: S(1), H(1), O(1), P(2), K(1), E(3), R(1)

Select exactly 1 P from 2 Ps: C(2,1) = 2 ways
Select 3 more letters from remaining 8 letters (S,H,O,K,E,E,E,R):

Need to consider cases based on number of Es selected:
- 0 Es: C(3,0) × C(5,3) = 1 × 10 = 10
- 1 E: C(3,1) × C(5,2) = 3 × 10 = 30  
- 2 Es: C(3,2) × C(5,1) = 3 × 5 = 15
- 3 Es: C(3,3) × C(5,0) = 1 × 1 = 1

Total ways to select 3 from remaining letters = 10 + 30 + 15 + 1 = 56

Total selections = 2 × 56 = 112

**Answer:** 112
