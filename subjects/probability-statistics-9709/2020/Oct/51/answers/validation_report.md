## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action Required:** Correct Questions 4 and 7d to achieve full marks
2. **Probability Distribution:** Carefully re-read problem definitions
3. **Selection Problems:** Use systematic scenario-based approach
4. **Verification:** Cross-check complex probability calculations

**Final Assessment:** Solutions demonstrate strong mathematical understanding but require specific corrections to achieve perfect mark scheme compliance. The errors are primarily due to misinterpretation of problem definitions rather than computational mistakes.
