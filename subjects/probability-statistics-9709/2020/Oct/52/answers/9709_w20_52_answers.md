## Question 1 (5 marks)

### Part (a) - Geometric Distribution [2 marks]

**Solution:**
P(success) = P(getting 4) = 1/6
P(failure) = 5/6

P(fewer than 6 throws) = P(success on throw 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5)
= 1 - P(first 5 throws are failures)
= 1 - (5/6)⁵
= 1 - 3125/7776
= 4651/7776 = 0.598

**Answer:** 0.598

**Marks awarded:** 2 marks

### Part (b) - Binomial Distribution [3 marks]

**Solution:**
X ~ B(10, 1/6) where X = number of 4s obtained

P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X ≤ 2) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)]

P(X = 0) = C(10,0) × (1/6)⁰ × (5/6)¹⁰ = 0.1615
P(X = 1) = C(10,1) × (1/6)¹ × (5/6)⁹ = 0.3230
P(X = 2) = C(10,2) × (1/6)² × (5/6)⁸ = 0.2907

P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - (0.1615 + 0.3230 + 0.2907) = 1 - 0.7752 = 0.225

**Answer:** 0.225

## Question 2 (7 marks)

### Part (a) - Show P(X = 1) = 15/56 [2 marks]

**Solution:**
Bag contains 5 red, 3 blue balls (total 8)
Taking 3 balls without replacement

P(X = 1) = P(exactly 1 red ball)
= C(5,1) × C(3,2) / C(8,3)
= 5 × 3 / 56
= 15/56 ✓

**Marks awarded:** 2 marks

### Part (b) - Probability Distribution Table [3 marks]

**Solution:**
X can take values 0, 1, 2, 3

P(X = 0) = C(5,0) × C(3,3) / C(8,3) = 1 × 1 / 56 = 1/56

P(X = 1) = 15/56 (from part a)

P(X = 2) = C(5,2) × C(3,1) / C(8,3) = 10 × 3 / 56 = 30/56

P(X = 3) = C(5,3) × C(3,0) / C(8,3) = 10 × 1 / 56 = 10/56

**Complete table:**
| X | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P(X=x) | 1/56 | 15/56 | 30/56 | 10/56 |

**Verification:** 1/56 + 15/56 + 30/56 + 10/56 = 56/56 = 1 ✓

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

### Part (c) - Variance [2 marks]

**Given:** E(X) = 15/8

**Solution:**
E(X²) = 0²(1/56) + 1²(15/56) + 2²(30/56) + 3²(10/56)
= 0 + 15/56 + 120/56 + 90/56
= 225/56

Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]²
= 225/56 - (15/8)²
= 225/56 - 225/64
= (225×64 - 225×56)/(56×64)
= 225(64-56)/(56×64)
= 225×8/(56×64)
= 1800/3584
= 225/448

**Answer:** Var(X) = 225/448

## Question 3 (9 marks)

### Part (a) - Normal Distribution [3 marks]

**Given:** X ~ N(10.1, 1.3²)

**Solution:**
P(X > 11.3) = P(Z > (11.3-10.1)/1.3) = P(Z > 1.2/1.3) = P(Z > 0.923)
= 1 - Φ(0.923) = 1 - 0.8220 = 0.178

**Answer:** 0.178

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

### Part (b) - Inverse Normal [3 marks]

**Solution:**
P(X > t) = 0.75
P(X ≤ t) = 0.25

P(Z ≤ (t-10.1)/1.3) = 0.25

From normal tables: Φ⁻¹(0.25) = -0.674

(t-10.1)/1.3 = -0.674
t - 10.1 = -0.8762
t = 9.22

**Answer:** t = 9.22

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

### Part (c) - Normal Probability Application [3 marks]

**Solution:**
P(8.9 < X < 11.3) = P((8.9-10.1)/1.3 < Z < (11.3-10.1)/1.3)
= P(-0.923 < Z < 0.923)
= Φ(0.923) - Φ(-0.923)
= 0.8220 - (1 - 0.8220)
= 0.8220 - 0.1780 = 0.644

Expected number of days = 90 × 0.644 = 58.0

**Answer:** 58 days

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

## Question 4 (9 marks)

### Part (a) - Complete Tree Diagram [1 mark]

**Solution:**
From the given information:
- P(Fine on 1 April) = 0.8, so P(Rainy on 1 April) = 0.2
- P(Fine on 2 April | Fine on 1 April) = 0.75, so P(Rainy on 2 April | Fine on 1 April) = 0.25
- P(Fine on 2 April | Rainy on 1 April) = 0.4, so P(Rainy on 2 April | Rainy on 1 April) = 0.6

**Tree diagram probabilities:**
- 0.8 → 0.75 (Fine → Fine)
- 0.8 → 0.25 (Fine → Rainy)
- 0.2 → 0.4 (Rainy → Fine)
- 0.2 → 0.6 (Rainy → Rainy)

**Marks awarded:** 1 mark

### Part (b) - P(2 April is fine) [2 marks]

**Solution:**
P(2 April is fine) = P(1 April fine AND 2 April fine) + P(1 April rainy AND 2 April fine)
= 0.8 × 0.75 + 0.2 × 0.4
= 0.6 + 0.08 = 0.68

**Answer:** 0.68

**Marks awarded:** 2 marks

### Part (c) - P(X ∩ Y) [3 marks]

**Solution:**
X = 1 April is fine, Y = 3 April is rainy

Need to find P(1 April fine AND 3 April rainy)

**Possible paths:**
1. Fine → Fine → Rainy: 0.8 × 0.75 × 0.25 = 0.15
2. Fine → Rainy → Rainy: 0.8 × 0.25 × 0.6 = 0.12

P(X ∩ Y) = 0.15 + 0.12 = 0.27

**Answer:** P(X ∩ Y) = 0.27

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

### Part (d) - P(X|Y) [3 marks]

**Solution:**
P(X|Y) = P(X ∩ Y) / P(Y)

From part (c): P(X ∩ Y) = 0.27

Need P(Y) = P(3 April is rainy):
**All paths to rainy on 3 April:**
1. Fine → Fine → Rainy: 0.8 × 0.75 × 0.25 = 0.15
2. Fine → Rainy → Rainy: 0.8 × 0.25 × 0.6 = 0.12
3. Rainy → Fine → Rainy: 0.2 × 0.4 × 0.25 = 0.02
4. Rainy → Rainy → Rainy: 0.2 × 0.6 × 0.6 = 0.072

P(Y) = 0.15 + 0.12 + 0.02 + 0.072 = 0.362

P(X|Y) = 0.27/0.362 = 0.746

**Answer:** P(X|Y) = 0.746

Dados | Stem | Linva
8 6   |  0   | 0 5 9
0 0 2 5 6 | 1 | 0 1 2 6
8 2   |  2   | 1
6     |  3   | 2 6
2     |  4   | 0
```

**Key:** 6|0|5 means 6 cm for Dados and 5 cm for Linva

**Marks awarded:** 4 marks

### Part (b) - Median and IQR for Dados [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Dados data in order: 6, 8, 10, 10, 12, 15, 16, 22, 28, 36, 42

n = 11, so median position = (11+1)/2 = 6th value
**Median = 15 cm**

Q₁ position = (11+1)/4 = 3rd value = 10 cm
Q₃ position = 3(11+1)/4 = 9th value = 28 cm

**IQR = Q₃ - Q₁ = 28 - 10 = 18 cm**

**Answer:** Median = 15 cm, IQR = 18 cm

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

### Part (c) - Comparison [2 marks]

**Solution:**
**Dados:** Median = 15 cm, IQR = 18 cm
**Linva:** Median = 12 cm, IQR = 32 - 9 = 23 cm

**Central Tendency:** Dados has higher median (15 vs 12), indicating generally more snowfall.

**Spread:** Linva has greater IQR (23 vs 18), indicating more variable snowfall.

Number of ways to divide 9 people into groups of 6 and 3:
= C(9,6) = C(9,3) = 9!/(6!×3!) = 84

**Answer:** 84

**Marks awarded:** 2 marks

### Part (b) - Probability of All Baker Children [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Total ways to select 5 from 9 people = C(9,5) = 126

Ways to select 5 people including all 3 Baker children:
= C(3,3) × C(6,2) = 1 × 15 = 15

Probability = 15/126 = 5/42

**Answer:** 5/42

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

**Solution:**
Total arrangements = 9! = 362,880

Arrangements with Mr Ahmed next to Mr Baker:
Treat them as one unit: 8! × 2! = 80,640

Arrangements with Mr Ahmed NOT next to Mr Baker:
= 362,880 - 80,640 = 282,240

**Answer:** 282,240

**Marks awarded:** 3 marks

### Part (d) - Exactly one person between Mr Ahmed and Mr Baker [3 marks]

**Solution:**
Pattern: Ahmed - Person - Baker or Baker - Person - Ahmed

**Method:** Choose positions for the trio, then arrange within
- Choose 3 consecutive positions from 9: 7 ways
- Arrange Ahmed-Person-Baker: 2 ways (Ahmed first or Baker first)
- Choose the middle person: 7 ways
- Arrange remaining 6 people: 6! ways

Total = 7 × 2 × 7 × 6! = 7 × 2 × 7 × 720 = 70,560
