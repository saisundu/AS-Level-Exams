## Question 1 (6 marks)
**Topic:** Normal Distribution

The times taken to swim 100 metres by members of a large swimming club have a normal distribution with mean 62 seconds and standard deviation 5 seconds.

### Part (a) (3 marks)
Find the probability that a randomly chosen member of the club takes between 56 and 66 seconds to swim 100 metres.

**Solution:**
Let X ~ N(62, 5²)

We need P(56 < X < 66)

Standardizing:
- For X = 56: Z = (56 - 62)/5 = -6/5 = -1.2
- For X = 66: Z = (66 - 62)/5 = 4/5 = 0.8

P(56 < X < 66) = P(-1.2 < Z < 0.8)
                = Φ(0.8) - Φ(-1.2)
                = Φ(0.8) - [1 - Φ(1.2)]
                = Φ(0.8) + Φ(1.2) - 1

From normal tables:
- Φ(0.8) = 0.7881
- Φ(1.2) = 0.8849

P(56 < X < 66) = 0.7881 + 0.8849 - 1 = 0.673

**Answer: 0.673**

### Part (b) (3 marks)
13% of the members of the club take more than t minutes to swim 100 metres. Find the value of t.

**Solution:**
We need P(X > t) = 0.13
Therefore P(X ≤ t) = 1 - 0.13 = 0.87

From normal tables, Φ(z) = 0.87 gives z = 1.126

Using standardization:
(t - 62)/5 = 1.126
t - 62 = 5 × 1.126
t = 62 + 5.63
t = 67.63 seconds

Converting to minutes: t = 67.63/60 = 1.127 minutes

**Answer: t = 1.13 minutes**

## Question 2 (5 marks)
**Topic:** Geometric Distribution

### Part (a) (2 marks)
An ordinary fair die is thrown until a 6 is obtained. Find the probability that obtaining a 6 takes more than 8 throws.

**Solution:**
This follows a geometric distribution with p = 1/6 (probability of success on each trial).

P(X > 8) = (1 - p)^8 = (5/6)^8

(5/6)^8 = 5^8/6^8 = 390625/1679616 ≈ 0.233

**Answer: 0.233**

### Part (b) (1 mark)
Two ordinary fair dice are thrown together until a pair of 6s is obtained. The number of throws taken is denoted by the random variable X. Find the expected value of X.

**Solution:**
Probability of getting a pair of 6s = (1/6) × (1/6) = 1/36

For a geometric distribution, E(X) = 1/p

E(X) = 1/(1/36) = 36

**Answer: E(X) = 36**

### Part (c) (2 marks)
Find the probability that obtaining a pair of 6s takes either 10 or 11 throws.

**Solution:**
Using geometric distribution with p = 1/36:

P(X = 10) = (1 - p)^(10-1) × p = (35/36)^9 × (1/36)
P(X = 11) = (1 - p)^(11-1) × p = (35/36)^10 × (1/36)

P(X = 10 or X = 11) = P(X = 10) + P(X = 11)
                     = (35/36)^9 × (1/36) + (35/36)^10 × (1/36)
                     = (1/36) × (35/36)^9 × [1 + 35/36]
                     = (1/36) × (35/36)^9 × (71/36)
                     = (71/36²) × (35/36)^9

Calculating: (35/36)^9 ≈ 0.7748
P(X = 10 or X = 11) = (71/1296) × 0.7748 ≈ 0.0424

**Answer: 0.0424**

## Question 3 (6 marks)
**Topic:** Combinations

A committee of 6 people is to be chosen from 9 women and 5 men.

### Part (a) (3 marks)
Find the number of ways in which the 6 people can be chosen if there must be more women than men on the committee.

**Solution:**
Total people = 9 + 5 = 14
Committee size = 6

For more women than men, possible compositions are:
- 4 women, 2 men
- 5 women, 1 man  
- 6 women, 0 men

Case 1: 4 women, 2 men
Number of ways = C(9,4) × C(5,2) = 126 × 10 = 1260

Case 2: 5 women, 1 man
Number of ways = C(9,5) × C(5,1) = 126 × 5 = 630

Case 3: 6 women, 0 men
Number of ways = C(9,6) × C(5,0) = 84 × 1 = 84

Total ways = 1260 + 630 + 84 = 1974

**Answer: 1974**

### Part (b) (3 marks)
The 9 women and 5 men include a sister and brother. Find the number of ways in which the committee can be chosen if the sister and brother cannot both be on the committee.

**Solution:**
Total ways to choose 6 from 14 people = C(14,6) = 3003

Ways where both sister and brother are on committee:
- Choose sister and brother (1 way)
- Choose remaining 4 from remaining 12 people = C(12,4) = 495

Ways where both are on committee = 1 × 495 = 495

Ways where sister and brother cannot both be on committee = 3003 - 495 = 2508

**Answer: 2508**

## Question 4 (8 marks)
**Topic:** Binomial Distribution and Normal Approximation

The 13:00 train from Jahor to Keman runs every day. The probability that the train arrives late in Keman is 0.35.

### Part (a) (3 marks)
For a random sample of 7 days, find the probability that the train arrives late on fewer than 3 days.

**Solution:**
Let X ~ B(7, 0.35)

P(X < 3) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)

P(X = 0) = C(7,0) × (0.35)^0 × (0.65)^7 = 1 × 1 × 0.0490 = 0.0490
P(X = 1) = C(7,1) × (0.35)^1 × (0.65)^6 = 7 × 0.35 × 0.0754 = 0.1848
P(X = 2) = C(7,2) × (0.35)^2 × (0.65)^5 = 21 × 0.1225 × 0.1160 = 0.2985

P(X < 3) = 0.0490 + 0.1848 + 0.2985 = 0.532

**Answer: 0.532**

### Part (b) (5 marks)
A random sample of 142 days is taken. Use an approximation to find the probability that the train arrives late on more than 40 days.

**Solution:**
Let X ~ B(142, 0.35)

For large n, we can use normal approximation:
μ = np = 142 × 0.35 = 49.7
σ² = np(1-p) = 142 × 0.35 × 0.65 = 32.305
σ = √32.305 = 5.683

Using continuity correction:
P(X > 40) = P(X ≥ 40.5) (with continuity correction)

Standardizing: Z = (40.5 - 49.7)/5.683 = -9.2/5.683 = -1.619

P(X > 40) = P(Z > -1.619) = 1 - Φ(-1.619) = Φ(1.619)

From normal tables: Φ(1.619) ≈ 0.947

**Answer: 0.947**

## Question 5 (7 marks)
**Topic:** Arrangements and Conditional Probability

The 8 letters in the word RESERVED are arranged in a random order.

### Part (a) (3 marks)
Find the probability that the arrangement has V as the first letter and E as the last letter.

**Solution:**
The word RESERVED has 8 letters: R, E, S, E, R, V, E, D
Letters: R(2), E(3), S(1), V(1), D(1)

Total arrangements of RESERVED = 8!/(2!×3!) = 40320/12 = 3360

Arrangements with V first and E last:
- Fix V in first position and E in last position
- Arrange remaining 6 letters: R, E, S, E, R, D
- These have R(2), E(2), S(1), D(1)
- Arrangements = 6!/(2!×2!) = 720/4 = 180

Probability = 180/3360 = 3/56

**Answer: 3/56**

### Part (b) (4 marks)
Find the probability that the arrangement has both Rs together given that all three Es are together.

**Solution:**
This is a conditional probability problem.

Let A = event that both Rs are together
Let B = event that all three Es are together

We need P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B)

First, find P(B):
Treat the three Es as one unit. We have: (EEE), R, S, R, V, D = 6 units
Arrangements = 6!/2! = 360 (dividing by 2! for the two Rs)
P(B) = 360/3360 = 3/28

Next, find P(A ∩ B):
Both Rs together AND all three Es together
Treat (EEE) as one unit and (RR) as one unit
We have: (EEE), (RR), S, V, D = 5 units
Arrangements = 5! = 120
P(A ∩ B) = 120/3360 = 1/28

Therefore: P(A|B) = (1/28)/(3/28) = 1/3

**Answer: 1/3**

## Question 6 (8 marks)
**Topic:** Probability Distributions

Three coins A, B and C are each thrown once.
- Coins A and B are each biased so that the probability of obtaining a head is 2/3
- Coin C is biased so that the probability of obtaining a head is 4/5

### Part (a) (3 marks)
Show that the probability of obtaining exactly 2 heads and 1 tail is 4/9.

**Solution:**
P(Head) for coins A and B = 2/3, P(Tail) = 1/3
P(Head) for coin C = 4/5, P(Tail) = 1/5

Possible ways to get exactly 2 heads and 1 tail:
1. HHT: A=Head, B=Head, C=Tail
2. HTH: A=Head, B=Tail, C=Head  
3. THH: A=Tail, B=Head, C=Head

P(HHT) = (2/3) × (2/3) × (1/5) = 4/45
P(HTH) = (2/3) × (1/3) × (4/5) = 8/45
P(THH) = (1/3) × (2/3) × (4/5) = 8/45

Total probability = 4/45 + 8/45 + 8/45 = 20/45 = 4/9 ✓

**Answer: Shown that P(exactly 2 heads) = 4/9**

### Part (b) (3 marks)
The random variable X is the number of heads obtained when the three coins are thrown. Draw up the probability distribution table for X.

**Solution:**
X can take values 0, 1, 2, 3

P(X = 0) = P(TTT) = (1/3) × (1/3) × (1/5) = 1/45

P(X = 1) = P(HTT) + P(THT) + P(TTH)
         = (2/3)(1/3)(1/5) + (1/3)(2/3)(1/5) + (1/3)(1/3)(4/5)
         = 2/45 + 2/45 + 4/45 = 8/45

P(X = 2) = 4/9 = 20/45 (from part a)

P(X = 3) = P(HHH) = (2/3) × (2/3) × (4/5) = 16/45

**Probability Distribution Table:**
| X | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P(X) | 1/45 | 8/45 | 20/45 | 16/45 |

**Answer: Table shown above**

### Part (c) (2 marks)
Given that E(X) = 32/15, find Var(X).

**Solution:**
We need to find E(X²) first.

E(X²) = 0² × P(X=0) + 1² × P(X=1) + 2² × P(X=2) + 3² × P(X=3)
      = 0 × (1/45) + 1 × (8/45) + 4 × (20/45) + 9 × (16/45)
      = 0 + 8/45 + 80/45 + 144/45
      = 232/45

Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]²
       = 232/45 - (32/15)²
       = 232/45 - 1024/225

Converting to common denominator:
232/45 = 1160/225

Var(X) = 1160/225 - 1024/225 = 136/225

**Answer: Var(X) = 136/225**

## Question 7 (10 marks)
**Topic:** Histograms and Statistics

A particular piece of music was played by 91 pianists and for each pianist, the number of incorrect notes was recorded.

| Number of incorrect notes | 1-5 | 6-10 | 11-20 | 21-40 | 41-70 |
|---------------------------|-----|------|-------|-------|-------|
| Frequency                 | 10  | 5    | 26    | 32    | 18    |

### Part (a) (5 marks)
Draw a histogram to represent this information.

**Solution:**
First, calculate class widths and frequency densities:

| Class | Class Width | Frequency | Frequency Density |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1-5   | 5           | 10        | 10/5 = 2.0       |
| 6-10  | 5           | 5         | 5/5 = 1.0        |
| 11-20 | 10          | 26        | 26/10 = 2.6      |
| 21-40 | 20          | 32        | 32/20 = 1.6      |
| 41-70 | 30          | 18        | 18/30 = 0.6      |

**Histogram:** (Heights correspond to frequency densities)
- Bar 1 (1-5): Height = 2.0
- Bar 2 (6-10): Height = 1.0  
- Bar 3 (11-20): Height = 2.6
- Bar 4 (21-40): Height = 1.6
- Bar 5 (41-70): Height = 0.6

**Answer: Histogram drawn with correct frequency densities**

### Part (b) (2 marks)
State which class interval contains the lower quartile and which class interval contains the upper quartile. Hence find the greatest possible value of the interquartile range.

**Solution:**
Total frequency = 91
Q₁ position = 91/4 = 22.75, so Q₁ is the 23rd value
Q₃ position = 3×91/4 = 68.25, so Q₃ is the 69th value

Cumulative frequencies:
- 1-5: 10
- 1-10: 15  
- 1-20: 41
- 1-40: 73
- 1-70: 91

Q₁ (23rd value) is in class 11-20
Q₃ (69th value) is in class 21-40

Greatest possible IQR occurs when:
- Q₁ is at the start of its class: Q₁ = 11
- Q₃ is at the end of its class: Q₃ = 40

Greatest possible IQR = 40 - 11 = 29

**Answer: Q₁ in 11-20, Q₃ in 21-40, Greatest IQR = 29**

### Part (c) (3 marks)
Calculate an estimate for the mean number of incorrect notes.

**Solution:**
Using midpoints of each class:

| Class | Midpoint | Frequency | f × x |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| 1-5   | 3        | 10        | 30    |
| 6-10  | 8        | 5         | 40    |
| 11-20 | 15.5     | 26        | 403   |
| 21-40 | 30.5     | 32        | 976   |
| 41-70 | 55.5     | 18        | 999   |
| Total |          | 91        | 2448  |

Mean = Σ(f × x) / Σf = 2448/91 = 26.9

**Answer: Mean ≈ 26.9 incorrect notes**
