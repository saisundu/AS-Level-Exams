## Question 1: Geometric Distribution [5 marks]

### Part (a): Show P(score = 4) = 1/12 [1 mark]
**Show that the probability that the score is 4 when throwing two dice is 1/12.**

**Solution:**
Ways to get a score of 4 with two dice:
- (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)

Total ways = 3
Total possible outcomes = 6 × 6 = 36

P(score = 4) = 3/36 = 1/12 ✓

**Answer: 1/12** (shown)

### Part (b): Find mean of X [1 mark]
**X is the number of throws until first score of 4. Find E(X).**

**Solution:**
This follows a geometric distribution with p = 1/12.

For geometric distribution: E(X) = 1/p = 1/(1/12) = 12

**Answer: E(X) = 12**

### Part (c): First success on 6th throw [1 mark]
**Find P(score of 4 first obtained on 6th throw).**

**Solution:**
For geometric distribution: P(X = r) = (1-p)^(r-1) × p

P(X = 6) = (11/12)^5 × (1/12)
         = (11/12)^5 × (1/12)
         = 0.5584 × (1/12)
         = 0.0465

**Answer: 0.0465**

### Part (d): Find P(X < 8) [2 marks]
**Find the probability that fewer than 8 throws are needed.**

**Solution:**
P(X < 8) = P(X ≤ 7) = 1 - P(X ≥ 8) = 1 - (11/12)^7

P(X < 8) = 1 - (11/12)^7 = 1 - 0.5132 = 0.487

**Answer: 0.487**

## Question 2: Permutations with Restrictions [6 marks]

### Part (a): Es together and Ls together [2 marks]
**Find arrangements of JEWELLERY where 3 Es are together and 2 Ls are together.**

**Solution:**
JEWELLERY has: J(1), E(3), W(1), L(2), R(1), Y(1) = 9 letters

Treat EEE as one unit and LL as one unit.
Units to arrange: [EEE], [LL], J, W, R, Y = 6 units

Number of arrangements = 6! = 720

**Answer: 720**

### Part (b): Ls are NOT next to each other [4 marks]
**Find arrangements where the two Ls are not next to each other.**

**Solution:**
Step 1: Total arrangements of JEWELLERY
Total = 9!/(3! × 2!) = 362,880/12 = 30,240

Step 2: Arrangements where Ls ARE together
Treat LL as one unit: [LL], J, E, E, E, W, R, Y = 8 units
Arrangements = 8!/3! = 40,320/6 = 6,720

Step 3: Arrangements where Ls are NOT together
= Total - (Ls together) = 30,240 - 6,720 = 23,520

**Answer: 23,520**

## Question 3: Hypergeometric and Binomial Distributions [7 marks]

### Part (a): Probability distribution for jellies [4 marks]
**Box has 5 jellies, 3 chocolates. Jemeel chooses 3 sweets. Find distribution for number of jellies.**

**Solution:**
This follows hypergeometric distribution.
Total sweets = 8, choosing 3
Let X = number of jellies chosen

P(X = 0) = C(5,0) × C(3,3) / C(8,3) = 1 × 1 / 56 = 1/56
P(X = 1) = C(5,1) × C(3,2) / C(8,3) = 5 × 3 / 56 = 15/56
P(X = 2) = C(5,2) × C(3,1) / C(8,3) = 10 × 3 / 56 = 30/56
P(X = 3) = C(5,3) × C(3,0) / C(8,3) = 10 × 1 / 56 = 10/56

**Probability Distribution Table:**
| X | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P(X) | 1/56 | 15/56 | 30/56 | 10/56 |

### Part (b): No more than 7 boxes [3 marks]
**10 large boxes, P(more jellies than chocolates) = 0.64. Find P(≤ 7 boxes have more jellies).**

**Solution:**
This follows binomial distribution: X ~ B(10, 0.64)

P(X ≤ 7) = 1 - P(X ≥ 8) = 1 - [P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10)]

P(X = 8) = C(10,8) × (0.64)^8 × (0.36)^2 = 45 × 0.0281 × 0.1296 = 0.164
P(X = 9) = C(10,9) × (0.64)^9 × (0.36)^1 = 10 × 0.0180 × 0.36 = 0.0648
P(X = 10) = C(10,10) × (0.64)^10 × (0.36)^0 = 1 × 0.0115 × 1 = 0.0115

P(X ≤ 7) = 1 - (0.164 + 0.0648 + 0.0115) = 1 - 0.240 = 0.760

**Answer: 0.760**

## Question 4: Complex Combinations [4 marks]
**8 pianists, 4 guitarists, 6 violinists. Select 7 finalists with: ≥2 pianists, ≥1 guitarist, more violinists than guitarists.**

**Solution:**
Need to consider valid combinations where violinists > guitarists:

**Case 1: 2P, 1G, 4V** (4 > 1 ✓)
C(8,2) × C(4,1) × C(6,4) = 28 × 4 × 15 = 1,680

**Case 2: 2P, 2G, 3V** (3 > 2 ✓)  
C(8,2) × C(4,2) × C(6,3) = 28 × 6 × 20 = 3,360

**Case 3: 3P, 1G, 3V** (3 > 1 ✓)
C(8,3) × C(4,1) × C(6,3) = 56 × 4 × 20 = 4,480

**Case 4: 3P, 2G, 2V** (2 > 2 ✗) - Invalid

**Case 5: 4P, 1G, 2V** (2 > 1 ✓)
C(8,4) × C(4,1) × C(6,2) = 70 × 4 × 15 = 4,200

Total = 1,680 + 3,360 + 4,480 + 4,200 = 13,720

**Answer: 13,720**

## Question 5: Tree Diagrams and Conditional Probability [8 marks]

### Part (a): Tree diagram [2 marks]
**Draw tree diagram for Rani's meal choices and fruit consumption.**

**Solution:**
```
                    Fruit (0.3)
        Pizza (0.35) ─┤
                    No Fruit (0.7)
                    
                    Fruit (0.8)
        Burger (0.44) ─┤
                    No Fruit (0.2)
                    
                    Fruit (0)
        Curry (0.21) ─┤
                    No Fruit (1)
```

### Part (b): P(has fruit) [2 marks]
**Find probability Rani has some fruit.**

**Solution:**
P(Fruit) = P(Pizza) × P(Fruit|Pizza) + P(Burger) × P(Fruit|Burger) + P(Curry) × P(Fruit|Curry)
         = 0.35 × 0.3 + 0.44 × 0.8 + 0.21 × 0
         = 0.105 + 0.352 + 0
         = 0.457

**Answer: 0.457**

### Part (c): P(not burger | no fruit) [4 marks]
**Find P(not burger | no fruit).**

**Solution:**
Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(A∩B)/P(B)

P(No Fruit) = 1 - P(Fruit) = 1 - 0.457 = 0.543

P(Not Burger ∩ No Fruit) = P(Pizza ∩ No Fruit) + P(Curry ∩ No Fruit)
                          = 0.35 × 0.7 + 0.21 × 1
                          = 0.245 + 0.21 = 0.455

P(Not Burger | No Fruit) = 0.455/0.543 = 0.838

**Answer: 0.838**

## Question 6: Normal Distribution [9 marks]

### Part (a): P(50 < X < 60) for female snakes [4 marks]
**Female snakes: N(54, 6.1²). Find P(50 < X < 60).**

**Solution:**
X ~ N(54, 6.1²)

P(50 < X < 60) = P((50-54)/6.1 < Z < (60-54)/6.1)
                = P(-0.656 < Z < 0.984)
                = Φ(0.984) - Φ(-0.656)
                = 0.8375 - 0.2559
                = 0.582

**Answer: 0.582**

### Part (b): Estimate μ and σ for male snakes [5 marks]
**200 male snakes: 32 < 45cm, 17 > 56cm. Find μ and σ.**

**Solution:**
P(X < 45) = 32/200 = 0.16, so P(Z < (45-μ)/σ) = 0.16
From tables: z₁ = -0.994 (since Φ(-0.994) = 0.16)
Therefore: (45-μ)/σ = -0.994 ... (1)

P(X > 56) = 17/200 = 0.085, so P(X < 56) = 0.915
P(Z < (56-μ)/σ) = 0.915
From tables: z₂ = 1.372 (since Φ(1.372) = 0.915)
Therefore: (56-μ)/σ = 1.372 ... (2)

From equation (1): 45 - μ = -0.994σ → μ = 45 + 0.994σ
From equation (2): 56 - μ = 1.372σ → μ = 56 - 1.372σ

Setting equal: 45 + 0.994σ = 56 - 1.372σ
2.366σ = 11
σ = 4.65

μ = 45 + 0.994(4.65) = 45 + 4.62 = 49.6

**Answer: μ = 49.6, σ = 4.65**

## Question 7: Histograms and Statistics [11 marks]

### Part (a): Draw histogram [5 marks]
**Draw histogram for chocolate bar sales data.**

**Solution:**
Calculate frequency densities (frequency ÷ class width):

| Bars Sold | Frequency | Class Width | Frequency Density |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1-10 | 18 | 10 | 1.8 |
| 11-15 | 24 | 5 | 4.8 |
| 16-30 | 30 | 15 | 2.0 |
| 31-50 | 20 | 20 | 1.0 |
| 51-60 | 8 | 10 | 0.8 |

The histogram should show bars with heights 1.8, 4.8, 2.0, 1.0, 0.8 respectively.

### Part (b): Greatest possible IQR [2 marks]
**Find greatest possible value of interquartile range.**

**Solution:**
Total frequency = 100
Q₁ position = 25th value, Q₃ position = 75th value

Cumulative frequencies:
- 1-10: 18
- 1-15: 42 (so Q₁ in 11-15 class)
- 1-30: 72 (so Q₃ in 31-50 class)
- 1-50: 92
- 1-60: 100

For greatest possible IQR:
- Q₁ should be at minimum of its class: Q₁ = 11 (bottom of 11-15 class)
- Q₃ should be at maximum of its class: Q₃ = 50 (top of 31-50 class)

Greatest possible IQR = 50 - 11 = 39

**Answer: 39**

### Part (c): Mean and standard deviation [4 marks]
**Calculate estimates of mean and standard deviation.**

**Solution:**
Using midpoints: 5.5, 13, 23, 40.5, 55.5

Mean = (18×5.5 + 24×13 + 30×23 + 20×40.5 + 8×55.5)/100
     = (99 + 312 + 690 + 810 + 444)/100
     = 2355/100 = 23.55

For standard deviation:
Σfx² = 18(5.5)² + 24(13)² + 30(23)² + 20(40.5)² + 8(55.5)²
     = 18(30.25) + 24(169) + 30(529) + 20(1640.25) + 8(3080.25)
     = 544.5 + 4056 + 15870 + 32805 + 24642
     = 77917.5

Variance = 77917.5/100 - (23.55)² = 779.175 - 554.6025 = 224.573

Standard deviation = √224.573 = 15.0

**Answer: Mean = 23.6, Standard deviation = 15.0**
