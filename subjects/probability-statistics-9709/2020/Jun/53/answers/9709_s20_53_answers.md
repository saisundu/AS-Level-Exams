## Question 1 [6 marks total]
**Juan goes to college by car (P=0.2), bus (P=0.45), or walking (P=0.35). Arrival probabilities: car early=0.6, bus early=0.1, walking early=1.0.**

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Draw a fully labelled tree diagram.**

### Solution:
```
                    Car (0.2) ──── Early (0.6)
                   /              └── Late (0.4)
Start ────────────── Bus (0.45) ──── Early (0.1)
                   \              └── Late (0.9)
                    Walk (0.35) ──── Early (1.0)
                                └── Late (0.0)
```

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: Fully correct labelled tree for method of transport with correct probabilities
✓ B1: Fully correct labelled branches with correct probabilities for lateness

### Part (b) [4 marks]
**Find P(goes by car | arrives early).**

### Solution:
Using Bayes' theorem: P(Car | Early) = P(Car ∩ Early) / P(Early)

First, find P(Early):
P(Early) = P(Car) × P(Early|Car) + P(Bus) × P(Early|Bus) + P(Walk) × P(Early|Walk)
P(Early) = 0.2 × 0.6 + 0.45 × 0.1 + 0.35 × 1.0
P(Early) = 0.12 + 0.045 + 0.35 = 0.515

Now find P(Car ∩ Early):
P(Car ∩ Early) = 0.2 × 0.6 = 0.12

Therefore:
P(Car | Early) = 0.12/0.515 = 12/51.5 = 24/103 ≈ 0.233

**Answer: 12/51.5 = 0.233**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: P(C|E) = P(C∩E)/P(E) = (0.2×0.6)/(0.2×0.6 + 0.45×0.1 + 0.35×1)
✓ M1: Summing three appropriate 2-factor probabilities
✓ A1: 0.12/0.515
✓ A1: 0.233 or 12/51.5

## Question 2 [4 marks total]
**In a college, 22% of students own a car.**

### Part (a) [1 mark]
**Find P(all 3 randomly chosen students own a car).**

### Solution:
P(all 3 own car) = (0.22)³ = 0.010648 ≈ 0.0106

**Answer: 0.0106**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: 0.22³ = 0.0106

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**For 16 students, find P(2 ≤ X ≤ 4) where X = number who own a car.**

### Solution:
X ~ B(16, 0.22)

P(2 ≤ X ≤ 4) = P(X=2) + P(X=3) + P(X=4)

P(X=2) = ¹⁶C₂ × (0.22)² × (0.78)¹⁴ = 120 × 0.0484 × 0.0308 = 0.1792
P(X=3) = ¹⁶C₃ × (0.22)³ × (0.78)¹³ = 560 × 0.0106 × 0.0395 = 0.2359
P(X=4) = ¹⁶C₄ × (0.22)⁴ × (0.78)¹² = 1820 × 0.0023 × 0.0506 = 0.2162

P(2 ≤ X ≤ 4) = 0.1792 + 0.2359 + 0.2162 = 0.631

**Answer: 0.631**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: P(2,3,4) = ¹⁶C₂(0.22)²(0.78)¹⁴ + ¹⁶C₃(0.22)³(0.78)¹³ + ¹⁶C₄(0.22)⁴(0.78)¹²
✓ A1: 0.179205 + 0.235877 + 0.216221
✓ A1: 0.631

## Question 3 [5 marks total]
**TV watching time X ~ N(15.8, 4.2²) hours per week.**

### Part (a) [2 marks]
**Find P(X < 21).**

### Solution:
Standardizing: Z = (21 - 15.8)/4.2 = 5.2/4.2 = 1.238

P(X < 21) = P(Z < 1.238) = Φ(1.238) = 0.892

**Answer: 0.892**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: P(X < 21) = P(Z < (21-15.8)/4.2) = Φ(1.238)
✓ A1: 0.892

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Find k such that P(X < k) = 0.75.**

### Solution:
P(X < k) = 0.75
P(Z < (k-15.8)/4.2) = 0.75

From normal tables: Φ(0.674) = 0.75
So: (k - 15.8)/4.2 = 0.674
k - 15.8 = 0.674 × 4.2 = 2.831
k = 15.8 + 2.831 = 18.631 ≈ 18.6

**Answer: k = 18.6**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: z = ±0.674
✓ M1: (k-15.8)/4.2 = 0.674
✓ A1: 18.6

## Question 4 [6 marks total]
**Two spinners: 4-sided (1,2,2,3) and 3-sided (-2,-1,1). X = sum of numbers.**

### Part (a) [3 marks]
**Draw up the probability distribution table for X.**

### Solution:
4-sided spinner: P(1) = 1/4, P(2) = 2/4 = 1/2, P(3) = 1/4
3-sided spinner: P(-2) = 1/3, P(-1) = 1/3, P(1) = 1/3

Possible sums and their probabilities:
- X = -1: (1,-2) → P = (1/4)(1/3) = 1/12
- X = 0: (1,-1) or (2,-2) → P = (1/4)(1/3) + (1/2)(1/3) = 1/12 + 2/12 = 3/12
- X = 1: (2,-1) or (3,-2) → P = (1/2)(1/3) + (1/4)(1/3) = 2/12 + 1/12 = 3/12
- X = 2: (1,1) or (3,-1) → P = (1/4)(1/3) + (1/4)(1/3) = 1/12 + 1/12 = 2/12
- X = 3: (2,1) → P = (1/2)(1/3) = 2/12
- X = 4: (3,1) → P = (1/4)(1/3) = 1/12

| X | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| P(X) | 1/12 | 3/12 | 3/12 | 2/12 | 2/12 | 1/12 |

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: Probability distribution table with correct scores with at least one probability
✓ B1: At least 4 probabilities correct
✓ B1: All probabilities correct

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Find Var(X).**

### Solution:
E(X) = (-1)(1/12) + (0)(3/12) + (1)(3/12) + (2)(2/12) + (3)(2/12) + (4)(1/12)
     = -1/12 + 0 + 3/12 + 4/12 + 6/12 + 4/12 = 16/12 = 4/3

E(X²) = (-1)²(1/12) + (0)²(3/12) + (1)²(3/12) + (2)²(2/12) + (3)²(2/12) + (4)²(1/12)
      = 1/12 + 0 + 3/12 + 8/12 + 18/12 + 16/12 = 46/12 = 23/6

Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]²
       = 23/6 - (4/3)²
       = 23/6 - 16/9
       = 69/18 - 32/18 = 37/18

**Answer: Var(X) = 37/18 ≈ 2.06**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: E(X) = 4/3
✓ M1: Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]² with correct substitution
✓ A1: 37/18 (= 2.06)

## Question 5 [9 marks total]
**Fair coins thrown repeatedly until pair of tails obtained. X = number of throws required.**

### Part (a) [1 mark]
**Find E(X).**

### Solution:
This is a geometric distribution. P(TT) = 1/4, so X ~ Geo(1/4)
E(X) = 1/p = 1/(1/4) = 4

**Answer: E(X) = 4**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: 1/(1/4) = 4

### Part (b) [1 mark]
**Find P(exactly 3 throws required).**

### Solution:
P(X = 3) = P(not TT, not TT, TT) = (3/4)² × (1/4) = 9/64 ≈ 0.141

**Answer: P(X = 3) = 9/64 = 0.141**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: (3/4)² × (1/4) = 9/64 = 0.141

### Part (c) [2 marks]
**Find P(fewer than 6 throws required).**

### Solution:
P(X < 6) = 1 - P(X ≥ 6) = 1 - (3/4)⁵ = 1 - 243/1024 = 781/1024 ≈ 0.763

**Answer: P(X < 6) = 0.763**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: P(X < 6) = 1 - (3/4)⁵ (FT their probability/mean from part (a))
✓ A1: 0.763

### Part (d) [5 marks]
**Use approximation to find P(more than 25 pairs of tails in 80 throws).**

### Solution:
Let Y = number of pairs of tails in 80 throws
Y ~ B(80, 1/4)

Using normal approximation:
μ = np = 80 × 0.25 = 20
σ² = np(1-p) = 80 × 0.25 × 0.75 = 15
σ = √15 = 3.873

With continuity correction:
P(Y > 25) = P(Y ≥ 25.5)

Standardizing: Z = (25.5 - 20)/√15 = 5.5/3.873 = 1.42

P(Y > 25) = P(Z > 1.42) = 1 - Φ(1.42) = 1 - 0.9222 = 0.0778

**Answer: 0.0778**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: Mean = 80 × 0.25 = 20, Var = 80 × 0.25 × 0.75 = 15
✓ M1: P(more than 25) = P(Z > (25.5-20)/√15)
✓ M1: P(z > 1.42)
✓ M1: 1 - 0.9222
✓ A1: 0.0778

✓ B1: Correct B on same diagram
✓ B1: Correct key for their diagram, both companies identified and correct units

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Find median and IQR for company A.**

### Solution:
Company A data in order: 30, 32, 35, 41, 41, 42, 47, 49, 52, 53, 64

For n = 11:
- Median position = (11+1)/2 = 6th value → Median = $42,000
- Lower quartile position = (11+1)/4 = 3rd value → LQ = $35,000
- Upper quartile position = 3(11+1)/4 = 9th value → UQ = $52,000
- IQR = $52,000 - $35,000 = $17,000

**Answer: Median = $42,000, IQR = $17,000**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: Median = [$]42,000
✓ B1: LQ = [$]35,000, UQ = [$]52,000
✓ B1: IQR = [$]17,000 (FT if 49000≤UQ≤53000, 32000≤LQ≤41000)

### Part (c) [3 marks]
**New employee joins B. Mean of 12 employees is $38,500. Find new salary.**

### Solution:
Sum of original 11 salaries in B:
26 + 47 + 30 + 52 + 41 + 38 + 35 + 42 + 49 + 31 + 42 = $433,000

Sum of 12 salaries = 12 × $38,500 = $462,000

New employee's salary = $462,000 - $433,000 = $29,000

**Answer: $29,000**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: Sum of given 11 numbers is 433,000
✓ M1: Sum of 12 numbers = 38,500 × 12 = 462,000
✓ A1: Difference = new salary = [$]29,000

## Question 7 [10 marks total]
**The word CELESTIAL has 9 letters: C(1), E(2), L(2), S(1), T(1), I(1), A(1)**

### Part (a) [1 mark]
**Find number of arrangements of CELESTIAL.**

### Solution:
Number of arrangements = 9!/(2!×2!) = 362880/4 = 90,720

**Answer: 90,720**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: 9!/(2!×2!) = 90,720

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**Find arrangements with C first, T fifth, E last.**

### Solution:
Fix C, T, E in positions 1, 5, 9. Arrange remaining 6 letters: E, L, L, S, I, A
Number of arrangements = 6!/2! = 720/2 = 360

**Answer: 360**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: 6!/2!
✓ A1: 360

### Part (c) [4 marks]
**Find P(randomly chosen arrangement doesn't have two Es together).**

### Solution:
Total arrangements = 90,720 (from part a)

Arrangements with Es together:
Treat EE as one unit, arrange 8 objects: (EE), C, L, L, S, T, I, A
Number = 8!/2! = 40320/2 = 20,160

Arrangements with Es not together = 90,720 - 20,160 = 70,560

P(Es not together) = 70,560/90,720 = 7/9 ≈ 0.778

**Answer: 7/9 = 0.778**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: 2 Es together = 8!/2! = 20,160
✓ M1: Es not together = 90,720 - 20,160 = 70,560
✓ M1: Probability = 70,560/90,720
✓ A1: 7/9 or 0.778
