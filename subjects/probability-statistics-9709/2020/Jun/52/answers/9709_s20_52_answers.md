## Question 1 [3 marks]
**For n values of the variable x, it is given that Σ(x - 50) = 144 and Σx = 944. Find the value of n.**

### Solution:
We know that:
- Σ(x - 50) = 144
- Σx = 944

Expanding the first equation:
Σ(x - 50) = Σx - Σ50 = Σx - 50n

Therefore:
Σx - 50n = 144

Substituting Σx = 944:
944 - 50n = 144

Solving for n:
50n = 944 - 144
50n = 800
n = 16

**Answer: n = 16**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: Correctly expanded Σ(x - 50) = Σx - 50n
✓ M1: Set up equation 944 - 50n = 144
✓ A1: Correct answer n = 16

## Question 2 [5 marks total]
**A total of 500 students were asked which college they attended and whether they preferred soccer or hockey.**

| College | Soccer | Hockey | Total |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| Amos    | 54     | 32     | 86    |
| Benn    | 84     | 72     | 156   |
| Canton  | 22     | 56     | 78    |
| Devar   | 120    | 60     | 180   |
| **Total** | **280** | **220** | **500** |

### Part (a) [1 mark]
**Find the probability that a randomly chosen student is at Canton college and prefers hockey.**

### Solution:
Number of students at Canton who prefer hockey = 56
Total number of students = 500

P(Canton and Hockey) = 56/500 = 14/125 = 0.112

**Answer: 56/500 = 14/125 = 0.112**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: Correct probability 56/500 or 14/125 or 0.112

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**Find the probability that a randomly chosen student is at Devar college given that he prefers soccer.**

### Solution:
This is a conditional probability: P(Devar | Soccer)

Using the formula: P(Devar | Soccer) = P(Devar ∩ Soccer) / P(Soccer)

Number of students at Devar who prefer soccer = 120
Total number of students who prefer soccer = 280

P(Devar | Soccer) = 120/280 = 3/7

**Answer: 120/280 = 3/7**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: Correct conditional probability setup P(D∩S)/P(S) = 120/280
✓ A1: Correct answer 120/280 = 3/7

### Part (c) [2 marks]
**Determine whether the events 'the student prefers hockey' and 'the student is at Amos college or Benn college' are independent.**

### Solution:
For independence, we need: P(H) × P(A ∪ B) = P(H ∩ (A ∪ B))

Calculating each probability:
- P(Hockey) = 220/500 = 0.44
- P(Amos or Benn) = (86 + 156)/500 = 242/500 = 0.484
- P(Hockey ∩ (Amos or Benn)) = (32 + 72)/500 = 104/500 = 0.208

Checking independence:
P(H) × P(A ∪ B) = 0.44 × 0.484 = 0.21296
P(H ∩ (A ∪ B)) = 0.208

Since 0.21296 ≠ 0.208, the events are **not independent**.

**Answer: Not independent**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: Calculated P(H) × P(A∪B) and P(H ∩ (A∪B)) correctly
✓ A1: Concluded not independent with correct reasoning

### Solution:
From the stem-and-leaf diagram, Machine A data (in order):
0.210, 0.211, 0.220, 0.221, 0.223, 0.224, 0.231, 0.231, 0.234, 0.237, 0.238, 0.243, 0.245, 0.250, 0.251, 0.253, 0.254, 0.255, 0.255

For n = 19 values:
- Median position = (19+1)/2 = 10th value
- Lower quartile position = (19+1)/4 = 5th value  
- Upper quartile position = 3(19+1)/4 = 15th value

- Median = 0.238 m
- Lower quartile = 0.231 m
- Upper quartile = 0.245 m
- IQR = 0.245 - 0.231 = 0.014 m

**Answer: Median = 0.238 m, IQR = 0.014 m**

### Mark Scheme Validation:

## Question 4 [8 marks total]
**Trees in the Redian forest are classified by height. Heights follow N(40, 12²). Trees < 25m are short.**

### Part (a) [3 marks]
**Find the probability that a randomly chosen tree is classified as short.**

### Solution:
Let X = height of tree, where X ~ N(40, 12²)

P(X < 25) = P(Z < (25-40)/12) = P(Z < -1.25)

Using normal tables: P(Z < -1.25) = 1 - P(Z < 1.25) = 1 - 0.8944 = 0.1056

**Answer: 0.106 (3 s.f.)**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: Standardization P(Z < (25-40)/12) = P(Z < -1.25)
✓ M1: Using 1 - 0.8944
✓ A1: 0.106

### Part (b) [2 marks]
**Show that the probability that a randomly chosen tree is classified as tall is 0.298.**

### Solution:
From part (a): P(short) = 0.106
Therefore: P(tall or medium) = 1 - 0.106 = 0.894

Given that of trees classified as tall or medium:
- 1/3 are tall
- 2/3 are medium

Therefore: P(tall) = (1/3) × 0.894 = 0.298

**Answer: 0.298 ✓**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: 0.8944 divided by 3 (using 1 - their (a) divided by 3)
✓ A1: 0.298 (Answer Given)

### Part (c) [3 marks]
**Find the height above which trees are classified as tall.**

### Solution:
Let h be the height above which trees are tall.

P(X > h) = 0.298
P(X ≤ h) = 1 - 0.298 = 0.702

From normal tables: P(Z ≤ 0.53) = 0.7019 ≈ 0.702

So: (h - 40)/12 = 0.53
h - 40 = 0.53 × 12 = 6.36
h = 40 + 6.36 = 46.36 ≈ 46.4 m

**Answer: 46.4 m**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: 0.2981 gives z = 0.53
✓ M1: (h-40)/12 = 0.53
✓ A1: h = 46.4

### Solution:
Possible outcomes for X = 3:
- 3-sided shows 3, 5-sided shows 1: P = (1/3) × (2/5) = 2/15
- 3-sided shows 3, 5-sided shows 2: P = (1/3) × (2/5) = 2/15  
- 3-sided shows 3, 5-sided shows 3: P = (1/3) × (1/5) = 1/15
- 3-sided shows 1, 5-sided shows 3: P = (1/3) × (1/5) = 1/15
- 3-sided shows 2, 5-sided shows 3: P = (1/3) × (1/5) = 1/15

Total: P(X = 3) = 2/15 + 2/15 + 1/15 + 1/15 + 1/15 = 7/15 ✓

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: Listed all scenarios leading to X = 3
✓ A1: P(X = 3) = 7/15 (Answer Given)

### Part (b) [3 marks]
**Draw up the probability distribution table for X.**

### Solution:

For X = 1:
- Both show 1: P = (1/3) × (2/5) = 2/15

For X = 2:
- Both show 2: P = (1/3) × (2/5) = 2/15
- 3-sided shows 2, 5-sided shows 1: P = (1/3) × (2/5) = 2/15
- 3-sided shows 1, 5-sided shows 2: P = (1/3) × (2/5) = 2/15
Total: P(X = 2) = 6/15

For X = 3: P(X = 3) = 7/15 (from part a)

✓ B1: P(1) or P(2) correct
✓ B1: 3rd probability correct, FT sum to 1

### Part (c) [3 marks]
**Find E(X) and Var(X).**

### Solution:
E(X) = 1×(2/15) + 2×(6/15) + 3×(7/15)
     = 2/15 + 12/15 + 21/15 = 35/15 = 7/3

E(X²) = 1²×(2/15) + 2²×(6/15) + 3²×(7/15)
      = 2/15 + 24/15 + 63/15 = 89/15

Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]²
       = 89/15 - (7/3)²
       = 89/15 - 49/9
       = 89/15 - 245/45
       = 267/45 - 245/45 = 22/45

**Answer: E(X) = 7/3, Var(X) = 22/45**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: E(X) = 7/3
✓ M1: Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]² with correct substitution
✓ A1: Var(X) = 22/45

## Question 7 [9 marks total]
**Moena messages Pasha with probability 0.72 each day.**

### Part (a) [3 marks]
**Find P(messages on no more than 9 days out of 12).**

### Solution:
Let X = number of days Moena messages Pasha in 12 days
X ~ B(12, 0.72)

P(X ≤ 9) = 1 - P(X ≥ 10) = 1 - [P(X=10) + P(X=11) + P(X=12)]

P(X=10) = ¹²C₁₀ × (0.72)¹⁰ × (0.28)² = 66 × 0.0372 × 0.0784 = 0.1937
P(X=11) = ¹²C₁₁ × (0.72)¹¹ × (0.28)¹ = 12 × 0.0268 × 0.28 = 0.0906
P(X=12) = (0.72)¹² = 0.0194

P(X ≤ 9) = 1 - (0.1937 + 0.0906 + 0.0194) = 1 - 0.3037 = 0.696

**Answer: 0.696**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: 1 - P(10,11,12) with correct binomial probabilities
✓ A1: 1 - (0.19372 + 0.09057 + 0.01941)
✓ A1: 0.696

### Part (b) [1 mark]
**Find P(next message day is 5 January | messaged on 1 January).**

### Solution:
This means no messages on 2, 3, 4 January, then message on 5 January.

P = (0.28)³ × 0.72 = 0.021952 × 0.72 = 0.0158

**Answer: 0.0158**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ B1: 0.28³ × 0.72 = 0.0158

### Part (c) [5 marks]
**Use approximation to find P(messages on fewer than 64 days out of 100).**

### Solution:
Let X = number of days with messages in 100 days
X ~ B(100, 0.72)

Using normal approximation:
μ = np = 100 × 0.72 = 72
σ² = np(1-p) = 100 × 0.72 × 0.28 = 20.16
σ = √20.16 = 4.49

With continuity correction:
P(X < 64) = P(X ≤ 63.5)

Standardizing: Z = (63.5 - 72)/4.49 = -8.5/4.49 = -1.893

P(Z < -1.893) = 0.0292

**Answer: 0.0292**

### Mark Scheme Validation:
✓ M1: Mean = 100 × 0.72 = 72, Var = 100 × 0.72 × 0.28 = 20.16
✓ M1: P(less than 64) = P((63.5-72)/√20.16 < z)
✓ M1: Using 63.5 within standardization formula
✓ M1: Appropriate area Φ from standardization P(z < -1.893)
✓ A1: 0.0292
