➡️ *AO1: definition + stages.*

### Q1 (b) Explain two ways a business could extend a product’s life cycle. [3]  
1. **Enter new markets** (AO2). E.g. a local brand exports abroad, generating fresh demand. (AO3: analysis).  
2. **Rebranding or relaunch**. E.g. smartphone with new features/packaging and promotional push. (AO2 + AO3).  
➡️ *Two explained methods = 3 marks.*

### Q3 Explain how better management of trade receivables and trade payables can improve cash flow. [5]

## Section B

### Q5 (a) Analyse the advantages of using different methods to measure the size of a business. [8]  

**Introduction**  
Business size can be measured by employees, revenue, capital, outlets, or market share. Using multiple methods gives accuracy. (AO1)

**Analysis**  
- **Employees**: useful in labour-intensive, less so in capital-intensive sectors.  
- **Revenue**: shows demand, but high-value vs low-value product differences distort.  
- **Capital employed**: scale of investment (e.g. airlines).  
- **Market share**: shows industry dominance.  
- **Outlets**: indicates geographical reach.  
➡️ *AO2 + AO3.*

**Conclusion**  
No single measure suffices. Multiple = balanced, reliable. (AO4)

### Q5 (b) Discuss whether a partnership is the best legal structure for an accountancy business. [12]  

**Introduction**  
Partnership = shared ownership, profit, liability. Critical in professional services. (AO1)

**Analysis**  
- **Advantages**: shared expertise (audit/tax), pooled capital, flexible management.  
- **Disadvantages**: unlimited liability, disputes, shared profits.  
- **Alternatives**: sole trader (small), LLP (liability protection + flexibility), Ltd (credibility, continuity).  
➡️ *AO2 + AO3.*

**Conclusion**  
Best at small scale, but long-term → **LLP better** (balances liability + flexibility). (AO4)

### Q6 ‘Using the Internet for marketing is essential to the success of a smartphone retailer.’ [20]  

**Introduction**  
Smartphone customers are digital natives. Online marketing = critical channel. (AO1)

**In favour**  
- Wide, cost-effective reach.  
- Engagement via reviews, influencers.  
- Dynamic pricing, personalised offers.  
➡️ *AO2 + AO3.*

**Counterarguments**  
- Many want to test devices in store.  
- Success also depends on product quality, brand reputation.  
- In some markets, internet access is limited.  

**Evaluation**  
Internet marketing = **essential, but not sufficient**. Offline + brand + service matter too.  

**Conclusion**  
Agree: vital in smartphones. Success = blended online/offline strategy. (AO4)

### Q7 (a) Analyse the benefits to a business of motivating its employees. [8]  

**Introduction**  
Motivation = internal/external drivers of employee effort. (AO1)

**Analysis**

- Better quality & innovation.  
- Improved morale, teamwork, service.  
➡️ *AO2 + AO3.*

**Conclusion**  
Motivation yields lower costs + strategic advantage. (AO4)

### Q7 (b) Discuss whether a salary is the best payment method for motivating employees of a shoe retailer. [12]  

**Introduction**  
Salary = fixed annual wage. Common in management, less effective for retail assistants. (AO1)

**Analysis – Benefits**  
- Security (Maslow’s safety needs).  
- Stability for managers.  

**Limitations**  
- Herzberg: pay is a hygiene factor, not motivator.  
- No link between effort and reward for shop-floor assistants.  

**Alternatives**  
- Commission (direct incentive).  
- Performance bonuses.  
- Non-financial motivators: training, recognition, promotion.  

**Conclusion**  
Salary alone insufficient. **Hybrid system** (salary + commission + non-financial incentives) motivates best. (AO4)
