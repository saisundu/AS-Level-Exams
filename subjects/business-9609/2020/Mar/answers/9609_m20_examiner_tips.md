## Section A: Short Answer Questions

### Q1 – Product Life Cycle
- ✅ **What earns marks**: Clear definition that it is the *pattern of sales from launch to withdrawal*, and naming stages like introduction, growth, maturity, decline.  
- ⚠️ **Common mistakes**: Just saying “time a product is in the market” without mentioning *sales pattern*; forgetting to name stages.  

### Q2 – Workforce Diversity
- ✅ **What earns marks**: Diversity = variety in demographics (age, gender, culture, ethnicity, religion, etc.). Benefits include *innovation* and *market reach*.  
- ⚠️ **Common mistakes**: Confusing “diversity” with “different skill sets only”; no reference to demographic differences.  

### Q3 – Trade Receivables & Payables
- ✅ **What earns marks**: Linking faster receivable collection to improved inflows and delayed payables to reduced outflows, with overall impact on liquidity.  
- ⚠️ **Common mistakes**: Defining receivables/payables but not explaining *how* they improve cash flow.  

### Q4 – Economies of Scale
- ✅ **What earns marks**: External = industry-wide advantages (e.g., suppliers, infrastructure). Internal = firm-specific (purchasing, financial, managerial).  
- ⚠️ **Common mistakes**: Mixing up internal vs external; listing economies without explanation.

## General Examiner Advice
- Always **define key terms** at the start of essays (AO1).  
- Use **contextual application** (AO2): don’t just drop names like “Apple” or “Nike”, show why the example matters.  
- Build **analysis chains** (AO3): “Because … leads to … therefore …”.  
- Make a **judgement** (AO4): weigh both sides, state conditions (“depends on …”), and conclude clearly.  
- Avoid **generic lists**. Answers must be structured paragraphs.
