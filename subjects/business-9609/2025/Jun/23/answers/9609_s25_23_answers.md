## Question 1: Crafty Toys (CT) - Co-operative Business

### (a)(i) Identify one feature of a co-operative. [1 mark]

**Answer**: Owned and controlled by its members who share the profits/benefits.

**Alternative answers**:
- Democratic decision-making by members
- Members have equal voting rights regardless of investment
- Profits distributed among members based on participation/usage

### (a)(ii) Explain the term traditional manager functions. [3 marks]

**Answer**: Traditional manager functions refer to the core activities that managers typically perform to ensure effective business operations (1 mark). These include planning (setting objectives and strategies), organizing (arranging resources and structure), leading (motivating and directing employees), and controlling (monitoring performance and making corrections) (1 mark). In CT's case, these functions are shared among the 12 members rather than being performed by a single manager (1 mark).

### (b)(i) Calculate the labour productivity for CT in 2024. [3 marks]

**Calculation**:
- Total output = 54,000 units
- Number of people = 12
- Labour productivity = Output รท Number of workers

**Answer**: 
Labour productivity = 54,000 รท 12 = 4,500 units per person per year (3 marks)

**Mark allocation**:
- Correct formula (1 mark)
- Correct substitution (1 mark) 
- Correct answer with units (1 mark)

### (b)(ii) Explain one advantage to CT of labour-intensive operations. [3 marks]

**Answer**: Higher quality products (1 mark). Because CT makes wooden toys using labour-intensive techniques, workers can pay close attention to detail and craftsmanship, ensuring each toy meets quality standards (1 mark). This is particularly important for CT as they target parents who want quality products for their children, helping to differentiate their products from mass-produced alternatives (1 mark).

**Alternative advantages**:
- **Flexibility**: Can easily adapt production to meet changing customer demands
- **Lower capital investment**: Requires less expensive machinery and equipment
- **Employment creation**: Provides jobs in rural areas where CT operates

### (c) Analyse two methods of primary market research that CT could use to identify customer wants. [8 marks]

#### Method 1: Surveys/Questionnaires (4 marks)

**Explanation**: CT could create online surveys distributed through their website and social media platforms to gather customer feedback (1 mark). 

**Advantages**: 
- Cost-effective way to reach existing customers who already buy online
- Can gather quantitative data about preferences for toy types, colors, sizes
- Can reach a large number of customers quickly

**Analysis**: This would be particularly suitable for CT because they already sell online and have established digital platforms (1 mark). They could ask specific questions about what types of wooden toys customers want, preferred price ranges, and safety features that matter most to parents (1 mark). The data collected would help CT focus their limited resources on producing the most demanded products rather than guessing what customers want (1 mark).

#### Method 2: Focus Groups (4 marks)

**Explanation**: CT could organize focus groups with parents and children to observe reactions to new toy prototypes and gather in-depth feedback (1 mark).

**Advantages**:
- Provides detailed qualitative insights about customer preferences
- Allows observation of children's actual reactions to toys
- Can test new product ideas before committing to production

**Analysis**: This method would be valuable for CT because wooden toys need to appeal to both children (who play with them) and parents (who buy them) (1 mark). Focus groups would allow CT to understand the emotional connection customers have with handmade toys and identify specific features that make toys more appealing (1 mark). Given CT's emphasis on quality and safety, focus groups could help identify which natural finishes and designs resonate most with their target market (1 mark).

### (d) Evaluate whether CT should change to flow production. [12 marks]

#### Arguments FOR changing to flow production:

**Reduced costs** (3 marks): Flow production typically achieves economies of scale, reducing the cost per unit of production. For CT, this could address their challenge of high production costs by spreading fixed costs over more units and potentially negotiating better prices for materials when buying in larger quantities. This cost reduction could make their products more competitively priced.

**Shorter lead times** (3 marks): Flow production uses continuous processes and standardized procedures, which typically reduce production time. CT currently faces long lead times, which may frustrate customers who want toys quickly. Faster production would improve customer satisfaction and could increase sales, especially during peak seasons like Christmas.

**Increased output capacity** (2 marks): Flow production could significantly increase CT's total output from 54,000 units annually, allowing them to meet higher demand and potentially expand into new markets or retail partnerships.

#### Arguments AGAINST changing to flow production:

**Loss of craftsmanship and differentiation** (3 marks): CT's current competitive advantage lies in their handmade, quality wooden toys that appeal to parents seeking alternatives to mass-produced items. Flow production would likely standardize their products and reduce the artisanal quality that differentiates them from larger toy manufacturers. This could damage their brand identity and unique selling proposition.

**Contradiction with co-operative values** (2 marks): The co-operative was formed by people passionate about making toys who wanted to work together. Flow production might require specialization and division of labor that could reduce job satisfaction and go against their collaborative working approach.

**High initial investment required** (2 marks): Converting to flow production would require significant capital investment in machinery and equipment, which may be difficult for a small co-operative to finance. The current labor-intensive approach requires lower capital investment.

**Still requires skilled workers** (2 marks): Flow production won't necessarily solve CT's challenge of requiring skilled workers, as they would still need people who understand woodworking and toy safety requirements.

#### Evaluation and Conclusion:

The decision depends on CT's priorities and long-term objectives. If CT prioritizes growth, market expansion, and cost competitiveness, flow production could be beneficial. However, if they value maintaining their artisanal quality, co-operative working culture, and product differentiation, they should remain with labor-intensive production.

**Recommendation**: CT should NOT change to flow production because their competitive advantage lies in quality, handmade products that justify premium pricing. Instead, they should focus on improving efficiency within their current system through better training, improved workshop layout, or selective automation of non-critical processes.

**Final marks**: Arguments for (8 marks) + Arguments against (9 marks) + Evaluation/judgment (3 marks) = **Total possible: 12 marks**

## Question 2: Fresh Farm (FF) - Partnership Business

### (a)(i) Identify one feature of a partnership. [1 mark]

**Answer**: Shared ownership between two or more partners.

**Alternative answers**:
- Unlimited liability for partners
- Shared decision-making and control
- Partners contribute capital and share profits/losses

### (a)(ii) Explain the term working capital. [3 marks]

**Answer**: Working capital is the money available for day-to-day business operations (1 mark). It is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities, representing the short-term funds needed to pay for expenses like wages, materials, and bills (1 mark). For FF, the working capital provided by Amrit, Harry, and Sally would be used to buy seeds, pay for labor during planting and harvesting, and cover operating expenses until crops are sold (1 mark).

### (b)(i) Calculate FF's profit in 2024. [3 marks]

**Calculation**:
- Revenue: $120,000
- Total costs = Direct costs + Indirect costs = $50,000 + $30,000 = $80,000
- Profit = Revenue - Total costs

**Answer**: 
Profit = $120,000 - $80,000 = $40,000 (3 marks)

**Mark allocation**:
- Correct formula (1 mark)
- Correct calculation of total costs (1 mark)
- Correct final answer (1 mark)

### (b)(ii) Explain one factor influencing the supply of FF's products. [3 marks]

**Answer**: Weather conditions (1 mark). FF's supply is heavily dependent on weather patterns because they grow crops outdoors and rely on natural conditions for plant growth (1 mark). Poor weather such as droughts, floods, or storms can significantly reduce crop yields and quality, limiting the quantity of products FF can supply to customers, while favorable weather can increase supply (1 mark).

**Alternative factors**:
- **Pest and disease outbreaks**: Can damage crops and reduce supply
- **Seasonal variations**: Natural growing cycles limit when products are available
- **Labor availability**: Hand harvesting requires sufficient workers during harvest time

### (c) Analyse two benefits to FF of product differentiation. [8 marks]

#### Benefit 1: Premium Pricing (4 marks)

**Explanation**: Product differentiation allows FF to charge higher prices than competitors because their products offer unique value (1 mark).

**Analysis**: FF differentiates through organic, chemical-free farming methods and renewable energy use, which appeals to health-conscious and environmentally aware consumers (1 mark). These customers are willing to pay premium prices for products they perceive as healthier and more sustainable than conventionally grown alternatives (1 mark). The case study shows FF has gained loyal customers who appreciate quality, flavor, and nutrition, suggesting they successfully command higher prices than mass-produced alternatives, improving profit margins (1 mark).

#### Benefit 2: Reduced Competition and Customer Loyalty (4 marks)

**Explanation**: Differentiation creates unique selling propositions that are difficult for competitors to replicate exactly (1 mark).

**Analysis**: FF's combination of natural farming methods, renewable energy use, and direct-to-consumer sales creates a unique brand position that competitors cannot easily copy (1 mark). This differentiation has helped FF build a loyal customer base who specifically seek out their products for their quality and ethical production methods (1 mark). Customer loyalty reduces the threat from competitors and provides more stable demand, as shown by FF facing high demand that they struggle to meet rather than competing on price with other farms (1 mark).

### (d) Evaluate whether business growth is a suitable objective for FF. [12 marks]

#### Arguments FOR business growth as a suitable objective:

**Market demand exists** (3 marks): The case study clearly states that FF faces "high level of demand" for its products that they currently cannot meet. This unsatisfied demand represents a clear opportunity for growth. Customers want "fresh, varied and consistent products throughout the year," indicating strong market potential for expansion.

**Financial capability** (3 marks): FF's 2024 profit of $40,000 on revenue of $120,000 represents a healthy 33% profit margin, suggesting the business generates sufficient cash flow to potentially fund growth investments. The strong profitability indicates the business model is viable for expansion.

**Competitive advantages support growth** (2 marks): FF's differentiated position through organic farming and renewable energy gives them sustainable competitive advantages that could support larger-scale operations while maintaining premium pricing.

#### Arguments AGAINST business growth as a suitable objective:

**Capacity constraints are difficult to overcome** (4 marks): FF faces "limited capacity in producing crops" due to natural farming constraints. Unlike manufacturing businesses, agricultural production is limited by land availability, seasonal growing cycles, and natural processes. Expanding capacity would require acquiring more land, which may be expensive and difficult to find with suitable conditions for organic farming.

**Quality risks from expansion** (3 marks): FF's competitive advantage lies in quality, flavor, and nutrition achieved through careful natural farming methods and hand harvesting. Rapid growth could compromise these quality standards if the business cannot maintain the same attention to detail on a larger scale. This could damage their reputation and loyal customer base.

**Resource and management challenges** (3 marks): The partnership structure with three owners may struggle to manage a significantly larger operation. Growth would require additional skilled workers familiar with organic farming methods, more complex logistics for expanded distribution, and potentially more sophisticated management systems.

**Environmental and philosophical conflicts** (2 marks): FF was established with aims of producing healthy food using sustainable methods. Aggressive growth might conflict with these environmental values if it leads to more intensive farming practices or increased resource consumption.

#### Evaluation and Conclusion:

The suitability of growth depends on the type and pace of growth pursued. **Controlled, sustainable growth** that maintains FF's quality and environmental standards could be suitable, but **rapid expansion** would be risky.

**Recommendation**: FF should pursue **limited, strategic growth** by:
1. Gradually expanding cultivation area while maintaining organic standards
2. Improving efficiency of current operations before scaling up
3. Focusing on high-value products that maximize return per unit of land
4. Building partnerships with other organic farms to supply products they cannot grow

This approach would satisfy market demand while preserving the quality and values that created their competitive advantage.

**Final marks**: Arguments for (8 marks) + Arguments against (12 marks) + Evaluation/judgment (4 marks) = **Total possible: 12 marks**
