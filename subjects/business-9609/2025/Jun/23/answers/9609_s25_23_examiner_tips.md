## Question-Specific Tips

### Question 1: Crafty Toys (CT)

#### (a)(i) Identify one feature of a co-operative [1 mark]
**Examiner Tip**: 
- Give ONE clear feature only
- Don't over-explain for 1-mark questions
- Common acceptable answers: member ownership, democratic control, profit sharing
- **Avoid**: vague answers like "people work together"

#### (a)(ii) Explain traditional manager functions [3 marks]
**Examiner Tip**:
- **Definition** (1 mark) + **Examples** (1 mark) + **Context application** (1 mark)
- Use the acronym **POLC**: Planning, Organizing, Leading, Controlling
- Reference CT's shared management approach for context marks
- **Common mistake**: Only listing functions without explanation

#### (b)(i) Calculate labour productivity [3 marks]
**Examiner Tip**:
- **Always show your working** - marks awarded for method even if final answer is wrong
- **Formula**: Output ÷ Number of workers
- **Include units** in your final answer
- **Check reasonableness**: 4,500 units per person seems realistic
- **Common mistake**: Using hours worked instead of number of people

#### (b)(ii) Explain one advantage of labour-intensive operations [3 marks]
**Examiner Tip**:
- **Structure**: Advantage (1) + Explanation (1) + Context to CT (1)
- Link to CT's specific situation (wooden toys, quality focus, rural location)
- **Strong answers**: Quality, flexibility, lower capital costs, employment creation
- **Avoid**: Generic advantages without context to the case

#### (c) Analyse two methods of primary market research [8 marks]
**Examiner Tip**:
- **4 marks per method** - don't spend too long on one
- **Structure each method**: Method + How it works + Why suitable for CT + Benefits
- **Context is crucial**: Reference CT's online presence, target customers (parents), product type
- **Good methods**: Surveys, focus groups, interviews, observation
- **Show analysis**: Don't just describe - explain WHY each method suits CT specifically

#### (d) Evaluate whether CT should change to flow production [12 marks]
**Examiner Tip**:
- **Balanced evaluation** - arguments for AND against
- **Use case study evidence** - reference specific details about CT
- **Make a clear judgment** - state your recommendation with justification

#### (a)(i) Identify one feature of a partnership [1 mark]
**Examiner Tip**:
- **One feature only** - be precise

- Don't forget to add direct + indirect costs first
- **Common mistake**: Using only direct costs

#### (b)(ii) Explain one factor influencing supply [3 marks]
**Examiner Tip**:
- **Link to FF's context** - they're a farm, so weather/seasons are obvious

- **Good factors**: Weather, pests/diseases, seasonal variations, labor availability

#### (c) Analyse two benefits of product differentiation [8 marks]
**Examiner Tip**:
- **4 marks per benefit** - balanced coverage
