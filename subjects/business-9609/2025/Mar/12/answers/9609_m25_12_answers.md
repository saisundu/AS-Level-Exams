## Section A: Short Answer Questions

### Question 1(a): Define the term intrapreneur. [2 marks]
**AO1: Knowledge and Understanding**

**Answer:**
An intrapreneur is an employee within a business who thinks and acts like an entrepreneur by taking risks, being innovative and creative, challenging existing practices, and taking responsibility for new projects that improve business performance. Unlike entrepreneurs who start their own businesses, intrapreneurs work within existing organizations to drive innovation and change from within.

### Question 1(b): Explain one disadvantage of being a small business. [3 marks]
**AO1: Knowledge (1 mark) + AO2: Application (2 marks)**

**Answer:**
**Disadvantage:** Difficulty raising finance (AO1 - 1 mark)

**Explanation:** Small businesses often struggle to raise finance because lenders and investors view them as higher risk due to their limited track record, lack of collateral, and higher probability of failure compared to established businesses. This forces small business owners to rely on personal savings, take out expensive loans with high interest rates, or accept unfavorable investment terms. The limited access to finance restricts their ability to invest in growth opportunities, purchase necessary equipment, or maintain adequate cash flow during difficult periods, ultimately limiting their competitiveness and survival prospects.

### Question 2(a): Define the term psychographic market segmentation. [2 marks]
**AO1: Knowledge and Understanding**

**Answer:**
Psychographic market segmentation is a form of market segmentation that divides consumers into sub-groups based on shared psychographic criteria such as lifestyles, personalities, values, social class, attitudes, beliefs, interests, opinions, and spending habits. This approach goes beyond demographic factors to understand the psychological and behavioral characteristics that influence consumer purchasing decisions.

### Question 2(b): Explain one factor that might influence the demand for a product. [3 marks]
**AO1: Knowledge (1 mark) + AO2: Application (2 marks)**

**Answer:**
**Factor:** Income of customers (AO1 - 1 mark)

**Explanation:** Customer income directly affects their purchasing power and willingness to buy products. When customers experience an increase in disposable income, they are more likely to purchase both essential and luxury items, leading to increased demand. Conversely, during economic downturns or personal financial difficulties, customers reduce their spending on non-essential items and may switch to cheaper alternatives, causing demand to fall. For example, during a recession, demand for luxury cars decreases as customers prioritize essential expenses, while demand for budget vehicles may increase as people seek more affordable transportation options.

### Question 3(a): Define the term indirect costs. [2 marks]
**AO1: Knowledge and Understanding**

**Answer:**
Indirect costs are business expenses that cannot be identified with a specific unit of production or allocated accurately to a particular cost center. These are overhead expenses necessary for the overall operation of a business, such as rent, utilities, depreciation, administrative salaries, and insurance. Unlike direct costs, indirect costs are shared across multiple products or departments and must be apportioned using appropriate allocation methods.

### Question 3(b): Explain one benefit to a business of using budgets. [3 marks]
**AO1: Knowledge (1 mark) + AO2: Application (2 marks)**

**Answer:**
**Benefit:** Assists in the control and appropriate allocation of resources (AO1 - 1 mark)

**Explanation:** Budgets enable managers to monitor and control spending by setting predetermined limits for different departments and activities. Each manager knows exactly what resources they have available within their department, preventing overspending and ensuring funds are directed where they are most needed to improve business performance and efficiency. This builds financial accountability throughout the organization and allows senior management to identify areas where additional resources might be required or where cost savings can be achieved. For example, if the marketing department exceeds its budget, management can investigate whether this overspend is justified by increased sales or if corrective action is needed. (AO2 - 2 marks)

## Section A: Analysis Question

### Question 4: Analyse one impact on employees of trade union involvement in the workplace. [5 marks]
**AO1: Knowledge (1 mark) + AO2: Application (2 marks) + AO3: Analysis (2 marks)**

**Answer:**
**Impact:** Improved job security (AO1 - 1 mark)

**Application:** Trade unions represent and support employees who are threatened by redundancy, providing collective bargaining power that individual employees lack when negotiating with employers. Unions can challenge unfair dismissals, negotiate better redundancy packages, and work to minimize job losses during organizational restructuring. (AO2 - 2 marks)

**Analysis:** The collective power of trade unions gives employees significantly more protection than they would have as individuals because employers are more likely to consider the consequences of their actions when facing organized opposition. This increased job security has multiple effects on employees: it reduces stress and anxiety about potential job loss, allowing workers to focus more effectively on their roles and be more productive. Employees with greater job security are also more likely to invest in developing their skills and building long-term relationships with colleagues, knowing they have a stable future with the organization. However, this protection may also create complacency among some employees who feel they cannot be easily dismissed, potentially reducing their motivation to perform at their best. The psychological impact of job security also extends to employees' personal lives, as they can make long-term financial commitments and family planning decisions with greater confidence.

## Section B: Extended Response Questions

### Question 5(a): Analyse two limitations to a business of capital intensive operations. [8 marks]
**AO1: Knowledge (2 marks) + AO2: Application (2 marks) + AO3: Analysis (4 marks)**

**Answer:**

**Limitation 1: Expensive to set up** (AO1 - 1 mark)

**Application:** New machinery and equipment must be purchased, requiring significant initial capital investment that may necessitate taking out expensive loans. (AO2 - 1 mark)

**Analysis:** In the short-term, new machinery can be more expensive than employing workers to perform the same tasks, creating immediate financial pressure on the business. The company may not be able to afford this investment without external financing, which involves loan repayment costs including interest that reduce profitability for several years. This high initial cost also creates opportunity cost, as the capital could have been invested in other areas such as marketing, research and development, or market expansion that might generate returns more quickly. Small and medium-sized businesses may find it particularly difficult to access the necessary finance, limiting their ability to compete with larger, well-funded competitors who can afford capital-intensive operations. (AO3 - 2 marks)

**Limitation 2: Can be inflexible** (AO1 - 1 mark)

**Application:** Machinery may be designed for mass production of standardized products, making it difficult to adjust machines to produce different products or customize output to meet changing customer demands. (AO2 - 1 mark)

**Analysis:** This inflexibility becomes problematic when market conditions change or customer preferences shift, as the business cannot quickly adapt its production processes. Companies may lose niche market customers to competitors who can offer customized products, reducing market share and profitability. The inability to respond rapidly to market changes also means the business may continue producing products for which demand is declining, leading to excess inventory and waste. Furthermore, if new product innovations emerge in the market, capital-intensive businesses may find it costly and time-consuming to retool their operations, allowing more flexible competitors to gain first-mover advantages. This inflexibility can be particularly damaging in fast-moving industries where customer preferences change frequently. (AO3 - 2 marks)

### Question 5(b): 'A soft drinks manufacturer must improve its sustainability in order to compete successfully.' Evaluate this view. [12 marks]
**AO1: Knowledge (2 marks) + AO2: Application (2 marks) + AO3: Analysis (2 marks) + AO4: Evaluation (6 marks)**

**Answer:**

**Knowledge and Understanding:** (AO1 - 2 marks)
Sustainability refers to preventing waste and using the minimum of non-renewable resources so that levels of production can be sustained in the future without depleting natural resources or causing environmental damage. A manufacturer is engaged in secondary production, converting raw materials and components into finished products. Competing successfully means achieving and maintaining a competitive advantage that allows the business to outperform rivals in terms of market share, profitability, and long-term viability.

**Application/Context:** (AO2 - 2 marks)
Soft drinks include non-alcoholic beverages such as fruit juices, cordials, soda, and lemonade. The industry faces particular sustainability challenges related to packaging (plastic bottles, glass bottles, aluminum cans, cartons), water usage in production, sugar sourcing, and the environmental impact of distribution networks. Many soft drinks manufacturers are exploring recyclable packaging, refillable bottles, and reducing plastic waste to address environmental concerns.

**Analysis:** (AO3 - 2 marks)
Improving sustainability can provide several competitive advantages for soft drinks manufacturers. Customers are increasingly interested in production methods and environmental impact, which can influence their purchasing decisions and help expand the customer base among environmentally conscious consumers. This trend is particularly strong among younger demographics who are willing to pay premium prices for sustainable products. Sustainability initiatives can also reduce costs through recycling and reusing resources, using fewer raw materials, and reducing waste disposal expenses. Additionally, sustainable practices may attract investors, employees, and business partners who share similar values, improving the company's ability to raise capital and recruit talent.

However, implementing sustainability measures involves significant costs for changing supply chains and production methods. Manufacturers may need to invest in new packaging technologies, alternative energy sources, or more expensive sustainable raw materials. These changes require substantial capital investment and may temporarily reduce profitability while new systems are implemented.

**Evaluation:** (AO4 - 6 marks)

**Arguments supporting the statement:**
The soft drinks industry faces increasing pressure from environmental groups, government regulations, and consumer activism regarding plastic waste and environmental impact. Companies that fail to address these concerns risk boycotts, negative media coverage, and regulatory penalties that can severely damage their reputation and market position. Major competitors like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have already committed to significant sustainability initiatives, making it essential for other manufacturers to follow suit to remain competitive.

Consumer behavior is shifting toward sustainable products, particularly among millennials and Gen Z consumers who represent the future market. Companies that position themselves as environmentally responsible can command premium prices and build stronger brand loyalty. Government incentives and grants for sustainable practices can also offset some implementation costs.

**Arguments against the statement:**
The importance of sustainability may be overstated compared to other competitive factors such as taste, price, convenience, and brand recognition. Many consumers still prioritize cost and quality over environmental considerations, particularly in price-sensitive markets. The expense of implementing sustainable practices may force manufacturers to increase prices, potentially losing market share to cheaper alternatives.

Some sustainability initiatives may have limited impact on actual competitiveness if consumers don't change their purchasing behavior accordingly. The soft drinks market is highly competitive on price, and manufacturers may find that sustainability improvements don't translate into sufficient sales increases to justify the investment.

**Conclusion:**
While improving sustainability is increasingly important for soft drinks manufacturers, whether it is "essential" depends on several factors. For companies targeting premium markets or younger demographics, sustainability is likely crucial for competitive success. However, for manufacturers competing primarily on price in cost-sensitive markets, other factors such as operational efficiency and cost control may be more immediately important.

The most successful approach is likely to be a balanced strategy that incorporates sustainability improvements alongside other competitive priorities. Companies should implement cost-effective sustainability measures that align with their target market's values while ensuring they don't compromise on the fundamental factors that drive consumer choice in the soft drinks industry: taste, price, and availability.

### Question 6(a): Analyse two benefits to a business of using online recruitment methods. [8 marks]
**AO1: Knowledge (2 marks) + AO2: Application (2 marks) + AO3: Analysis (4 marks)**

**Answer:**

**Benefit 1: Cost effective** (AO1 - 1 mark)

**Application:** Businesses can pay as much or as little as they want for online recruitment, avoiding the high costs of traditional recruitment methods such as newspaper advertisements or recruitment agencies. (AO2 - 1 mark)

**Analysis:** When managed properly, online recruitment can save significant money compared to other methods. Traditional recruitment through newspapers, magazines, or recruitment agencies can cost thousands of dollars, while online job boards and social media platforms offer much more affordable options. This cost saving is particularly beneficial for small and medium-sized businesses with limited HR budgets, allowing them to allocate resources to other areas such as employee training or retention programs. The cost-effectiveness also enables businesses to advertise multiple positions simultaneously or run longer recruitment campaigns without exceeding their budget, potentially attracting a larger pool of qualified candidates. (AO3 - 2 marks)

**Benefit 2: Bigger audience** (AO1 - 1 mark)

**Application:** Online advertisements can be seen by potential applicants with internet connections globally, and can be easily shared through social media platforms like LinkedIn and Facebook. (AO2 - 1 mark)

**Analysis:** The global reach of online recruitment significantly expands the talent pool available to businesses, increasing the likelihood of finding highly qualified candidates who might not have seen traditional local advertisements. This is particularly valuable for specialized roles requiring specific skills or experience that may be rare in the local market. The viral nature of online content means that one person who sees the advertisement can easily share it with colleagues, friends, and family, creating a multiplier effect that extends the reach far beyond the initial posting. This expanded audience is especially beneficial for businesses looking to recruit diverse talent or fill positions that require specific technical expertise that may not be available locally. The ability to target specific demographics and professional groups through online platforms also ensures that advertisements reach the most relevant potential candidates. (AO3 - 2 marks)

### Question 6(b): 'Improving employee morale and welfare is the most important role of human resource management (HRM) in an airline business.' Evaluate this view. [12 marks]
**AO1: Knowledge (2 marks) + AO2: Application (2 marks) + AO3: Analysis (2 marks) + AO4: Evaluation (6 marks)**

**Answer:**

**Knowledge and Understanding:** (AO1 - 2 marks)
Employee morale refers to the satisfaction and confidence of employees within the workplace, while employee welfare encompasses the facilities and support systems essential for employee well-being. Human Resource Management (HRM) has multiple roles including workforce planning, recruitment, training, motivation, performance management, and handling redundancy and dismissal procedures.

**Application/Context:** (AO2 - 2 marks)
In an airline business, employees face unique challenges that can negatively impact morale and welfare: flights at anti-social hours, long periods away from home, standing for extended periods, difficulty moving in confined aircraft spaces, and dealing with aggressive or demanding passengers. HRM must address these specific challenges while ensuring cabin staff receive proper health and safety training, customer service training, and that experienced pilots are recruited and retained. The seasonal nature of airline demand also requires careful workforce planning.

**Analysis:** (AO3 - 2 marks)
Improving employee morale and welfare in airlines can have significant positive impacts. When employees have their safety and security needs met according to Maslow's hierarchy, they are less likely to leave the business, reducing costly labor turnover and recruitment expenses. Higher morale typically leads to increased motivation and better customer service, which is crucial in the airline industry where passenger experience directly affects reputation and repeat business. Satisfied employees are more likely to go above and beyond in their roles, potentially leading to positive customer reviews and word-of-mouth recommendations.

However, the nature of airline work presents inherent challenges to morale and welfare. The physical demands of the job, irregular schedules, and customer-facing stress are difficult to eliminate entirely. Additionally, providing adequate welfare facilities can be expensive and logistically challenging, particularly during flights where space is limited.

**Evaluation:** (AO4 - 6 marks)

**Arguments supporting the statement:**
In the airline industry, employee performance directly impacts passenger safety and satisfaction, making morale and welfare critically important. Poor morale can lead to safety lapses, which could have catastrophic consequences and destroy the airline's reputation. The service-intensive nature of the airline business means that motivated, satisfied employees are essential for delivering the high-quality customer experience that differentiates successful airlines from their competitors.

The high-stress environment of airline operations makes employee support particularly crucial. Flight delays, difficult passengers, and emergency situations require employees who are mentally and physically prepared to handle challenges effectively. Airlines with better employee morale often achieve higher customer satisfaction ratings and stronger financial performance.

**Arguments against the statement:**
While important, other HRM roles may be equally or more critical in airline operations. Recruitment is vital for ensuring the airline has qualified pilots, cabin crew, and ground staff with the necessary skills and certifications. The safety-critical nature of airline operations means that hiring the right people with appropriate qualifications and experience is paramount.

Training is another crucial HRM function, as airline employees must maintain current certifications and stay updated on safety procedures, new aircraft systems, and regulatory requirements. Inadequate training can lead to safety violations and regulatory penalties that could ground aircraft or revoke operating licenses.

Workforce planning is essential for managing the seasonal fluctuations in airline demand and ensuring adequate staffing levels during peak periods while controlling costs during slower periods. Poor workforce planning can result in flight cancellations, customer dissatisfaction, and financial losses.

**Contextual considerations:**
The importance of morale and welfare versus other HRM functions may depend on the current state of the airline. A startup airline might prioritize recruitment and training to build its workforce, while an established airline facing high turnover might focus more on morale and welfare. The competitive environment also matters – in highly competitive markets, customer service quality driven by employee morale might be the key differentiator.

**Conclusion:**
While improving employee morale and welfare is undoubtedly important in airline businesses, it may not be the "most important" HRM role in all circumstances. The airline industry's unique characteristics – safety requirements, regulatory compliance, and service intensity – mean that recruitment, training, and workforce planning are equally critical.

The most effective approach is likely an integrated HRM strategy that recognizes the interconnected nature of these functions. High-quality recruitment and training programs contribute to employee confidence and morale, while good morale and welfare support retention and performance. Rather than prioritizing one function over others, successful airline HRM should ensure all functions work together to create a competent, motivated, and well-supported workforce capable of delivering safe, reliable, and high-quality service to passengers.
