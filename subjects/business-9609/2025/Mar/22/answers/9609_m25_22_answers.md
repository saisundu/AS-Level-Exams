---

### Question 1(a)(ii): Explain the term primary sector. [3 marks]
**AO1: Knowledge (1 mark) + AO2: Application (2 marks)**

**Answer:**
**Knowledge:** The primary sector involves businesses that extract or produce natural resources and raw materials through processes such as agriculture, farming, mining, fishing, and forestry. (AO1 - 1 mark)

**Application:** Primary sector businesses are engaged in the initial stage of production where natural resources are obtained directly from the environment. For example, Frank's farming operation where he grows fruit including oranges represents primary sector activity, as he is cultivating agricultural products from the land. Other examples include oil extraction companies drilling for crude oil, mining companies extracting metals and minerals from the earth, and fishing companies harvesting seafood from oceans and rivers.

### Question 1(b)(i): Calculate the number of oranges that Frank needs to sell to break even in July 2025. [3 marks]

**Answer:**
**Step 1:** Calculate variable cost per unit
Variable cost per unit = Total variable costs ÷ Sales quantity
Variable cost per unit = $2,825 ÷ 5,650 = $0.50

**Step 2:** Calculate contribution per unit
Contribution per unit = Selling price per unit - Variable cost per unit
Contribution per unit = $0.80 - $0.50 = $0.30

**Step 3:** Calculate break-even quantity
Break-even quantity = Fixed costs ÷ Contribution per unit
Break-even quantity = $1,350 ÷ $0.30 = 4,500 oranges

**Answer: 4,500 oranges**

**Mark Scheme Alignment:** ✓ Correct formula, calculations, and final answer

### Question 1(b)(ii): Explain one limitation for Frank of using break-even analysis. [3 marks]
**AO1: Knowledge (1 mark) + AO2: Application (2 marks)**

**Answer:**
**Limitation:** Break-even analysis assumes that the selling price will remain constant at all output levels. (AO1 - 1 mark)

**Explanation:** This assumption may not be realistic for Frank's business because he currently uses competitive pricing, which means he adjusts his prices based on what competitors charge. If his competitors (the national supermarket and local fruit shop) change their prices, Frank may need to adjust his orange prices accordingly to remain competitive. Additionally, Frank is considering introducing price skimming in the future, which would involve changing his pricing strategy entirely. Market conditions, seasonal demand fluctuations, and the perishable nature of fruit may also force Frank to adjust prices through discounting to avoid waste, making the constant price assumption unrealistic for his business planning.

### Question 1(c): Analyse two benefits to Frank of operating as a sole trader. [8 marks]
**AO1: Knowledge (2 marks) + AO2: Application (2 marks) + AO3: Analysis (4 marks)**

**Answer:**

**Benefit 1: Keep all profit made without sharing** (AO1 - 1 mark)

**Application:** Frank used all of his redundancy money from his previous job with a large company to set up FF, representing his personal investment in the business. As a sole trader, all profits generated from selling fruit at the local market belong entirely to him. (AO2 - 1 mark)

**Analysis:** This complete ownership of profits provides Frank with strong financial incentives to work hard and make effective business decisions, as he directly benefits from every dollar of profit generated. The ability to retain all profits is particularly valuable for Frank as he has specific financial objectives, including increasing profit by 10% by the end of 2026 and achieving 25% profitability. Since he invested his own redundancy money, keeping all profits helps him recover his initial investment more quickly and build personal wealth. This financial benefit also provides Frank with greater flexibility to reinvest profits back into the business for expansion, equipment upgrades, or marketing activities without needing to negotiate with other owners about profit distribution. (AO3 - 2 marks)

**Benefit 2: Complete control over business decisions** (AO1 - 1 mark)

**Application:** Frank can make all decisions about his fruit farming and retail operations independently, including choices about pricing strategies (currently competitive pricing, considering price skimming), which products to grow and sell, and how to leverage his unique selling proposition of freshness. (AO2 - 1 mark)

**Analysis:** This decision-making autonomy allows Frank to respond quickly to market opportunities and changes without the delays that would occur if he needed to consult with partners or shareholders. For example, if Frank notices that customers prefer certain types of fruit or if weather conditions affect his crops, he can immediately adjust his production or pricing decisions. This speed of decision-making is particularly important in the fruit business where products are perishable and market conditions can change rapidly. Frank's ability to make quick decisions about competitive pricing helps him respond immediately to competitor price changes, maintaining his market position. The complete control also means Frank can pursue his personal vision for the business, such as maintaining his USP of freshness by selling fruit only hours after picking, without having to convince other owners of the strategy's value. (AO3 - 2 marks)

**Mark Scheme Alignment:** ✓ Two benefits with knowledge, application, and developed analysis

### Question 1(d): Evaluate whether Frank should introduce price skimming. [12 marks]
**AO1: Knowledge (2 marks) + AO2: Application (2 marks) + AO3: Analysis (2 marks) + AO4: Evaluation (6 marks)**

**Answer:**

**Knowledge and Understanding:** (AO1 - 2 marks)
Price skimming is a pricing strategy where a product is initially priced at a higher level than competitors to maximize revenue from customers who are willing to pay premium prices. This strategy is often used for new products or where a producer has a strong unique selling proposition (USP) that justifies higher prices. Price skimming assumes that demand is relatively price inelastic, meaning customers are less sensitive to price increases. The strategy may require price reductions over time as the market becomes more competitive or as the novelty of the product decreases.

**Application/Context:** (AO2 - 2 marks)
Frank currently uses competitive pricing for his fruit business, matching or closely following the prices set by his main competitors: a national supermarket with local stores and a fruit shop in the local city. Frank's key competitive advantage is freshness - his fruit is sold only hours after being picked, while competitors' fruit is grown hundreds of kilometers away. Frank operates as a sole trader selling at a local market one day per week, and he has specific financial objectives including increasing profit by 10% by the end of 2026 and achieving 25% profitability. His customers also value the seasonal variety of fruit he offers throughout the year.

**Analysis:** (AO3 - 2 marks)
Price skimming could benefit Frank because his strong USP of freshness provides justification for charging premium prices. Customers who highly value fresh, locally-grown fruit may be willing to pay more than supermarket prices, especially given that his fruit is significantly fresher than competitors' products. If demand proves to be price inelastic due to the quality advantage, Frank could increase his profit margins substantially while maintaining sales volumes, helping him achieve his 10% profit increase and 25% profitability targets.

However, price skimming also carries significant risks for Frank's business. His customers currently choose his products despite competitive pricing, but higher prices might drive price-sensitive customers to the more convenient national supermarket or local fruit shop. The market setting (selling at a local market once per week) may attract customers who are particularly price-conscious and looking for good value, making them more likely to switch to cheaper alternatives if Frank raises prices significantly.

**Evaluation:** (AO4 - 6 marks)

**Arguments supporting price skimming:**
Frank's freshness USP provides a legitimate basis for premium pricing, as customers receive demonstrably superior quality compared to competitors' products that have traveled hundreds of kilometers. The seasonal variety and local, personal service Frank provides could justify higher prices among customers who value these attributes. Given his profit objectives and the fact that he invested his own redundancy money, price skimming could help Frank achieve his financial goals more quickly and provide better return on his personal investment.

**Arguments against price skimming:**
The market environment presents challenges for premium pricing. Customers shopping at local markets may be particularly price-sensitive, and Frank's competitors offer significant convenience advantages (supermarket with multiple locations, city shop with regular hours) that could become more attractive if Frank's prices increase substantially. Frank currently operates only one day per week, limiting customer access compared to competitors, which could make price increases particularly risky.

**Contextual considerations:**
The success of price skimming depends heavily on the price elasticity of demand for Frank's products. If customers view fresh, local fruit as a luxury or specialty item, demand may be relatively inelastic, supporting higher prices. However, if customers primarily view fruit as a commodity and prioritize convenience and price over freshness, demand could be highly elastic, making price skimming counterproductive.

Frank's limited operating schedule (one day per week) may actually support price skimming by creating scarcity value, but it also limits his ability to capture market share if competitors respond with their own pricing strategies.

**Recommendation:**
Frank should consider a gradual approach to price skimming rather than implementing dramatic price increases immediately. He could start by raising prices modestly (10-15%) while closely monitoring customer response and sales volumes. This would allow him to test the price elasticity of demand for his products while minimizing the risk of losing significant market share.

The decision should also consider seasonal factors - Frank might implement higher prices during peak seasons when his variety advantage is strongest, while maintaining more competitive pricing during periods when his product range is limited. Given his strong USP and loyal customer base built over time, a carefully implemented price skimming strategy could help Frank achieve his profitability objectives while maintaining his market position.

## Case Study 2: Reliable Car Repairs (RCR)

### Question 2(a)(i): Identify one method of primary market research. [1 mark]
**AO1: Knowledge and Understanding**

**Answer:**
Questionnaires

**Mark Scheme Alignment:** ✓ Valid primary research method

---

### Question 2(a)(ii): Explain the term qualitative data. [3 marks]
**AO1: Knowledge (1 mark) + AO2: Application (2 marks)**

**Answer:**
**Knowledge:** Qualitative data describes customer opinions, characteristics, and subjective information that is not measurable in numerical or financial terms. (AO1 - 1 mark)

**Application:** Qualitative data focuses on the quality and nature of responses rather than quantities or statistics. It captures descriptive information about customer attitudes, preferences, satisfaction levels, and experiences that cannot be easily quantified. For example, when Freya conducted primary market research for RCR, the qualitative data showed that customers appreciated the speed of the repair service, with many repairs completed within 24 hours. This type of feedback provides insights into customer satisfaction and service quality perceptions that numerical data alone cannot capture. Other examples of qualitative data include customer comments about staff friendliness, opinions about service quality, or descriptions of their overall experience with the business. (AO2 - 2 marks)

**Mark Scheme Alignment:** ✓ Knowledge + Developed application with context

### Question 2(b)(i): Calculate the market growth for car repairs in city B between 2023 and 2024. [3 marks]

**Answer:**
**Step 1:** Calculate 2024 total market size
If RCR has 17% market share and sales of $123,165:
Total market size 2024 = $123,165 ÷ 0.17 = $724,500

**Step 2:** Calculate market growth
Market growth = 2024 market size - 2023 market size
Market growth = $724,500 - $700,000 = $24,500

**Answer: $24,500**

**Mark Scheme Alignment:** ✓ Correct calculation method and final answer

### Question 2(b)(ii): Explain one reason why RCR's objectives may change over time. [3 marks]
**AO1: Knowledge (1 mark) + AO2: Application (2 marks)**

**Answer:**
**Reason:** Achievement of previous objectives (AO1 - 1 mark)

**Explanation:** When businesses successfully achieve their existing objectives, they need to set new goals to continue growing and improving their performance. Once an objective has been accomplished, it no longer provides direction or motivation for future business activities, necessitating the establishment of new targets. (AO2 - 1 mark)

**Context:** RCR has been operating successfully for five years and has achieved consistent annual increases in market share, reaching 17% by 2024. Having established itself in the market and built a reputation for fast service (completing many repairs within 24 hours), RCR may have achieved its initial objectives of survival, market establishment, and customer satisfaction. Now that these foundational goals have been met, Freya and Kye may need to set new objectives such as expanding their service range, increasing efficiency further, or targeting higher profitability levels to continue the business's development and maintain competitive advantage in the growing car repair market. (AO2 - 1 mark)

### Question 2(c): Analyse two advantages to RCR of Kye using a democratic management style. [8 marks]
**AO1: Knowledge (2 marks) + AO2: Application (2 marks) + AO3: Analysis (4 marks)**

**Answer:**

**Advantage 1: Increased employee motivation** (AO1 - 1 mark)

**Application:** Kye supervises the two mechanics who have both been employed by RCR since the business was established five years ago. By involving these experienced mechanics in decision-making processes, Kye can tap into their expertise and make them feel valued as contributors to the business rather than just following orders. (AO2 - 1 mark)

**Analysis:** When employees feel their opinions are valued and they have input into decisions affecting their work, they typically experience higher job satisfaction and motivation levels. For RCR's mechanics, who have specialized skills and five years of experience with the business, being consulted on decisions related to repair processes, efficiency improvements, or customer service approaches would likely increase their engagement and commitment. This increased motivation translates directly into better performance, as motivated mechanics are more likely to work efficiently, take pride in their work quality, and go the extra mile to ensure customer satisfaction. Given that RCR's reputation depends heavily on the speed and quality of repairs (with many completed within 24 hours), having highly motivated mechanics is crucial for maintaining this competitive advantage and supporting the business's objective of increasing efficiency. (AO3 - 2 marks)

**Advantage 2: Better decision-making through diverse input** (AO1 - 1 mark)

**Application:** Since Freya and Kye have no experience repairing cars themselves, the two mechanics possess the technical expertise and practical knowledge essential for effective operational decisions. The mechanics' five years of experience with RCR means they understand the business's specific challenges, customer needs, and operational processes intimately. (AO2 - 1 mark)

**Analysis:** Democratic management allows Kye to leverage the mechanics' specialized knowledge and experience when making decisions about repair processes, inventory management, or service improvements. The mechanics' hands-on experience with different car types and repair challenges provides valuable insights that Kye, lacking technical expertise, might not consider independently. This collaborative approach leads to more informed and practical decisions that are more likely to be successfully implemented. For example, when considering the introduction of Just in Time (JIT) inventory management, the mechanics' input about which parts are most commonly needed, supplier reliability, and repair timing would be invaluable. Better decision-making ultimately supports RCR's efficiency objectives and helps maintain their competitive advantage in completing repairs quickly, as decisions are based on practical experience rather than theoretical knowledge alone. The mechanics' long tenure with the business also means they understand customer preferences and can contribute to decisions that enhance customer satisfaction and retention. (AO3 - 2 marks)

### Question 2(d): Evaluate whether RCR should introduce Just in Time (JIT). [12 marks]
**AO1: Knowledge (2 marks) + AO2: Application (2 marks) + AO3: Analysis (2 marks) + AO4: Evaluation (6 marks)**

**Answer:**

**Knowledge and Understanding:** (AO1 - 2 marks)
Just in Time (JIT) is an inventory management system where components and materials are ordered to be delivered precisely when they are needed in the production process, rather than being held in large quantities in storage. JIT aims to minimize inventory holding costs by reducing or eliminating stock levels, with customer orders often initiating the ordering of required inventory. This system requires careful coordination between suppliers and the business to ensure materials arrive exactly when needed to avoid production delays.

**Application/Context:** (AO2 - 2 marks)
RCR currently holds large quantities of inventory because different car types require different components for repairs. The business has established relationships with two suppliers who have provided parts since RCR was founded five years ago. RCR's competitive advantage lies in the speed of service, with many repairs completed within 24 hours, which customers particularly value. The business operates as a partnership between Freya and Kye, employs two experienced mechanics, and has an objective of increasing efficiency. RCR's market share has grown consistently over five years to reach 17% in 2024, indicating successful operations under the current inventory system.

**Analysis:** (AO3 - 2 marks)
Implementing JIT could provide several benefits for RCR. Reducing inventory levels would decrease storage costs and free up capital currently tied up in parts inventory, improving cash flow and allowing investment in other areas such as equipment or marketing. Lower inventory holding costs would directly support RCR's efficiency objectives by reducing operational expenses. JIT could also reduce waste from obsolete parts and ensure RCR always has the most current components available.

However, JIT implementation poses significant risks for RCR's business model. The company's key competitive advantage is speed of service, with many repairs completed within 24 hours. Any delays in parts delivery could severely impact this service promise and damage customer satisfaction. Car repairs often require immediate access to specific components, and waiting for parts delivery could extend repair times significantly, potentially losing customers to competitors who can complete repairs more quickly.

**Evaluation:** (AO4 - 6 marks)

**Arguments supporting JIT implementation:**
RCR's established five-year relationships with two suppliers provide a foundation for implementing JIT successfully. These long-term partnerships suggest reliable supplier relationships that could support the coordination required for JIT delivery schedules. The business's objective of increasing efficiency aligns well with JIT's cost-reduction benefits, as lower inventory holding costs would improve profitability and operational efficiency. The capital freed from inventory reduction could be invested in business improvements, staff training, or marketing to support continued market share growth.

**Arguments against JIT implementation:**
RCR's core competitive advantage - completing repairs within 24 hours - is fundamentally incompatible with potential JIT delays. Car repair customers typically need their vehicles back as quickly as possible, and any extension of repair times due to parts availability issues could severely damage RCR's reputation and market position. The car repair industry often involves unexpected component failures that require immediate replacement, making it difficult to predict parts needs in advance. Unlike manufacturing operations where production schedules can be planned, car repairs are largely reactive to customer problems, making JIT coordination challenging.

**Contextual considerations:**
The decision depends heavily on the reliability and proximity of RCR's suppliers. If suppliers can guarantee same-day or next-day delivery of commonly needed parts, JIT might be feasible for routine maintenance items while maintaining safety stock for emergency repairs. The nature of car repairs also varies - routine maintenance parts might be suitable for JIT, while emergency repair components may require immediate availability.

RCR's small scale (two mechanics) might actually support JIT implementation, as coordination and communication would be simpler than in larger operations. However, the limited scale also means less negotiating power with suppliers for priority delivery schedules.

**Recommendation:**
RCR should not implement a full JIT system due to the fundamental conflict with their speed-of-service competitive advantage. Instead, they should consider a hybrid approach that maintains safety stock for commonly needed emergency repair parts while implementing JIT for predictable, routine maintenance components.

A gradual implementation could start with non-critical parts that don't affect the 24-hour repair promise, allowing RCR to test supplier reliability and system effectiveness without risking their core competitive advantage. The business should also invest in better inventory management systems to optimize current stock levels without eliminating the buffer stock essential for maintaining their service speed promise.

Given RCR's successful track record and growing market share under the current system, the risks of JIT implementation likely outweigh the potential benefits. The business should focus on other efficiency improvements that don't compromise their key competitive advantage.
