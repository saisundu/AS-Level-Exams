# Efficient Processing Strategy for Remaining 14 Winter Papers

## Current Status
âœ… **Completed:** 2020/Oct/51 (Solutions + Validation)  
ðŸ“‹ **Remaining:** 14 papers across 2020-2024 Oct sessions

## Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Batch Processing (Most Efficient)
Process papers in groups of 3-4 to optimize context window usage:

**Batch 1:** 2020/Oct/52, 2020/Oct/53, 2021/Oct/51  
**Batch 2:** 2021/Oct/52, 2021/Oct/53, 2022/Oct/51  
**Batch 3:** 2022/Oct/52, 2022/Oct/53, 2023/Oct/51  
**Batch 4:** 2023/Oct/52, 2023/Oct/53, 2024/Oct/51  
**Batch 5:** 2024/Oct/52, 2024/Oct/53

### Option 2: Individual Processing (Most Thorough)
Process one paper at a time with full validation:
- Create solutions â†’ Validate against mark scheme â†’ Generate report
- Start fresh conversation for each paper to avoid context limits

### Option 3: Solutions-First Approach (Fastest)
1. Create all 14 solution files first
2. Then validate all solutions in separate sessions
3. Generate validation reports last

## Recommendation
I recommend **Option 2 (Individual Processing)** because:
- Ensures highest quality and accuracy
- Allows thorough validation against mark schemes
- Maintains consistent standards across all papers
- Prevents context window overflow issues

## Next Steps
Please specify which approach you prefer, and I'll continue with the next paper:
- **2020/Oct/52** (next in chronological order)

## Time Estimate
- Individual processing: ~15-20 minutes per paper
- Total estimated time: 4-5 hours for all 14 papers
- Can be done across multiple sessions if needed

## Quality Assurance
Each paper will include:
- Complete solutions with detailed working
- Mark scheme validation
- Comprehensive validation report
- Error identification and correction recommendations
