## How to Create GitHub Issues

### Method 1: Manual Creation (Recommended for Small Batches)

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Click "Issues" tab**
3. **Click "New Issue"**
4. **Copy content from each `.md` file in `sai_practice_issues/`**
5. **Add appropriate labels**:
   - `pure-mathematics-9709`
   - `practice-session`
   - `student-sai-krishnamoorthy`
   - `beginner`/`intermediate`/`advanced` (based on year)

### Method 2: Bulk Creation Script

Create a script to automate GitHub issue creation:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# bulk_create_issues.sh

for file in sai_practice_issues/*.md; do
    title=$(head -1 "$file" | sed 's/# //')
    body=$(tail -n +3 "$file")
    
    gh issue create \
        --title "$title" \
        --body "$body" \
        --label "pure-mathematics-9709,practice-session,student-sai-krishnamoorthy"
    
    echo "Created: $title"
    sleep 1  # Rate limiting
done
```

### Method 3: GitHub CLI (Fastest)

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI first: https://cli.github.com/

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Create issues from files
for file in sai_practice_issues/*.md; do
    gh issue create --title "$(head -1 "$file" | sed 's/# //')" --body-file "$file" --label "pure-mathematics-9709,practice-session,student-sai-krishnamoorthy"
done
```
